"""
Wrap ``http://`` / ``https://`` URLs in OSC 8 hyperlink escapes
so terminals that support shell-integration semantics (iTerm2,
Ghostty, kitty, Alacritty, WezTerm, modern Terminal.app, Windows
Terminal) render them as ⌘-clickable links.

OSC 8 format:

    \\x1b]8;;<url>\\x1b\\<display_text>\\x1b]8;;\\x1b\\

Terminals that don't understand OSC 8 just see the display text;
the escape bytes are silently consumed without disrupting the
visible output. This is the standard "graceful degradation"
behavior every modern terminal honors per the OSC 8 spec.

``LinkifyingConsole`` attaches destinations to Rich text before
line wrapping, including text inside panels, tables, and Markdown.
Each wrapped fragment retains the complete URL. ``linkify_ansi``
is a fallback for renderables that emit ANSI or segments directly;
already-linked fragments pass through unchanged.

#   - whitespace
#   - closing brackets / quotes / angle that commonly delimit URLs
#     in prose ("(see https://example.com)", "<https://...>",
#     '"https://..."').
#   - ANY C0 control byte or DEL (``\x00-\x1f``, ``\x7f``) — critically the
#     ESC (``\x1b``) that introduces an SGR/OSC escape. Rich renders an
#     autolinked URL as ``\x1b[..m<url>\x1b[0m`` (styled + reset); without
#     excluding ESC, the URL class swallows the trailing ``\x1b[0m`` reset
#     and embeds it INSIDE the OSC 8 link target built below
#     (``\x1b]8;;<url>\x1b[0m\x1b\\``), a malformed hyperlink that terminals
#     render by leaking the reset's tail ``0m`` as visible text before the
#     URL. Real URLs never contain raw control bytes (they are
#     percent-encoded), so excluding them is always safe.
#   - the ellipsis (…) used by display elision — it is never part of a
#     real URL, and a fragment cut at an ellipsis has lost its tail.
# Trailing punctuation (``.,;:!?``) is stripped in the substitution
# callback rather than excluded by the regex — e.g. "Visit
# https://example.com." should fire OSC 8 over the URL but leave
# the period after the close-OSC8.

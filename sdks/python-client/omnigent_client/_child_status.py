"""Canonical sub-agent "busy" predicate — the single source of truth shared
by the CLI REPL and SDK drivers.

A parent session's own ``status`` is per-session: a delegating agent fans out
sub-agents and returns to its own prompt, so the parent reads ``idle`` while
its children are still working. To answer *"is anything in this subtree still
working?"* both the CLI (the ``state: N agents running`` badge / ``↓`` menu in
:mod:`omnigent_ui_sdk.terminal`) and SDK rollups
(:meth:`SessionsNamespace.subtree_busy` / :meth:`SessionsChat.tree_busy`) need
one agreed definition of a *single* child being busy. That definition lives
here so the two can't drift.

The predicate mirrors the web ``SubagentsPanel`` ``childStatus`` semantics
(``web/src/shell/SubagentsPanel.tsx``): awaiting input outranks everything
(a sub-agent parked on an elicitation is still mid-turn), then ``launching``,
then the live ``busy`` flag, then any non-terminal ``current_task_status``.

This is deliberately stateless — no linger/debounce. The terminal host wraps it
with a UI-only linger window to stop the badge flickering between a child's
turns; an SDK eval driver wants the un-debounced ground truth instead.

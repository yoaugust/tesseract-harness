"""Deterministic corpus seeder for the performance benchmark.

The v1 harness booted an empty DB, so the read journeys measured a best-case
near-empty table. This seeds a sizeable, realistic corpus directly through the
store API (no HTTP, no runner) so ``list_sessions`` / ``get_session`` /
``load_conversation_history`` read a production-shaped volume.

Writes to the same DB URI the server later boots against; startup migrations
are an idempotent no-op on an at-head DB. The seed is deterministic (fixed RNG,
fixed counts) so the same config always yields the same corpus — which is what
makes "seed once, reuse" sound. The reuse marker records the Alembic head read
at seed time, so a corpus from an older schema is auto-reseeded (no manual
revision bookkeeping).

Listable-corpus recipe, per session (the permission grant is the gotcha — the
loopback server resolves every request to user ``"local"`` and
``list_sessions`` filters by it):

1. ``create_session_with_agent`` — conversation + session-scoped agent row.
2. ``permission_store.grant("local", sid, LEVEL_OWNER)`` — makes it listable.
3. one batched ``append(sid, items)`` — user-role message items.

Also seeds first-class projects (``projects`` rows owned by ``"local"``) and
files a fraction of sessions into them, so the project read journeys
(``list_projects`` / ``list_project_sessions``) measure a realistic sidebar —
a folder count and per-folder depth — instead of an empty project set.

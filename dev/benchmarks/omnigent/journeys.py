"""User-journey definitions and the runners that time them.

A :class:`Journey` names a user-facing operation, an optional per-journey
``setup`` that returns a context object, and a ``measure`` coroutine — the
timed unit. :func:`run_latency` times ``measure`` sequentially; journeys marked
``concurrency_safe`` can also be driven by :func:`run_throughput` with many
operations in flight.

v1 journeys are pure HTTP/API (server + DB, no runner, no LLM):

- ``list_sessions`` — the session-list read behind the sidebar/home.
- ``create_session`` — session creation cost (POST then DELETE).
- ``get_session`` — single-session snapshot load.
- ``load_conversation_history`` — history read, seeded runner-free via
  ``external_conversation_item`` (see :meth:`BenchEnvironment.seed_items`).
- ``fork_session`` — fork a session (deep-copy its items), then DELETE.
- ``add_comment`` — create a review comment on a file (DB write).
- ``list_projects`` — the sidebar project list (dual-read union of first-class
  projects + legacy ``omni_project`` label-projects).
- ``list_project_sessions`` — a project folder's session list, the
  ``?project=`` dual-read filter behind clicking a project in the sidebar.

``read_runner_file`` needs a runner but no LLM turn: it plants a file in the
runner environment (setup) and times the server → runner filesystem read proxy.

Full-turn journeys (``needs_runner=True``) drive a real turn through the runner
+ mock LLM. ``session_cold_start`` (``needs_host=True``) measures the real UI
new-conversation cold path: it spawns a host daemon once, then per iteration
creates a host-bound session (which fires ``host.launch_runner``), attaches the
SSE stream, sends the first message, and times to the first output-text delta —
so the span includes the on-demand runner launch + reverse-tunnel handshake the
UI's first message races, exactly as a real new chat pays it.

``session_cold_restart`` reuses one existing host-bound session. Before every
timed message it stops that session's runner outside the measured span; the
message then exercises the server's automatic relaunch path and times to the
first streamed response.

The framework (``Journey`` + the two runners) is harness-agnostic and reused
verbatim by phase-2 full-turn journeys.

        (fixed request count under concurrency). A latency journey that is
        ``concurrency_safe`` can additionally be run as throughput.
    :param measure: Coroutine performing exactly one timed operation, given
        the environment and the setup context.
    :param setup: Optional coroutine run once before timing; its return value
        is passed to ``measure`` (and ``teardown``) as ``ctx``.
    :param prepare: Optional coroutine run before every measured operation,
        outside that operation's latency timer. Used when each sample needs a
        repeatable precondition, such as an offline runner.
    :param teardown: Optional coroutine run once after timing, given ``ctx``.
    :param concurrency_safe: Whether many ``measure`` calls may run at once
        against a shared setup (true for read-only / independent-write HTTP
        journeys).
    :param needs_runner: Whether this journey drives a full agent turn and so
        requires ``BenchEnvironment(with_runner=True)`` (mock LLM + runner).
        HTTP/DB journeys leave this ``False``.
    :param needs_host: Whether this journey needs a real host daemon
        (``BenchEnvironment(with_host=True)``) so a host-bound session-create
        or restart can fire ``host.launch_runner``. Implies ``needs_runner``.
    :param max_iterations: Upper bound on latency iterations for this journey,
        clamping ``--iterations`` down (never up). Full-turn journeys cost ~1s+
        per op, so 100+ iterations would blow the CI time budget; they cap at a
        few samples per run and lean on ``--runs`` for repeats. ``None`` (HTTP
        journeys) means no cap.
    :param skip_warmup: When ``True``, the warmup phase is skipped regardless
        of ``--warmup``. Useful for expensive journeys where even a single
        warmup iteration would waste significant time.

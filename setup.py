"""Custom setuptools build for omnigent.

Generates ``omnigent/_build_info.py`` at wheel build time so the
CLI's update-check (``omnigent/update_check.py``) can tell the user
when their installed build is stale without having to consult
``git`` or hit a remote endpoint at startup.

All other build configuration lives in ``pyproject.toml``; this
file exists solely to register the cmdclass override that runs the
generator before ``build_py`` copies sources into the wheel.

The generated file is gitignored — it is recreated on every build
and only meaningful at install time, where it travels inside the
wheel alongside the rest of the package.

        The server mounts that directory at ``/`` when present
        (``omnigent/server/app.py``); when absent it serves an
        API-only JSON landing page and the web UI is unreachable.
        The bundle is Vite build output, not tracked in git, so a
        plain ``pip install .`` / ``uv tool install`` from a checkout
        would otherwise ship no UI — the single most common "the web
        UI doesn't load" report.

        ``web/`` is a package in a pnpm workspace (``pnpm-workspace.yaml``
        and ``pnpm-lock.yaml`` at the repo root, ``packageManager:
        pnpm@11.15.1`` in the root ``package.json``), so the install and
        build run against the **workspace root** with ``--filter web``,
        matching ``deploy/databricks/build.sh`` and the CI workflows.
        Running ``pnpm install`` from inside ``web/`` would miss the
        committed lockfile and resolve against ``package.json`` alone —
        the legacy npm path that hit peer-dependency conflicts.

        Build policy, chosen to fix that case without slowing the
        backend-only dev loop or breaking node-less CI:

        - Skip if ``web/`` is absent (sdists that don't vendor it).
        - Skip if ``OMNIGENT_SKIP_WEB_UI=true``. The hardened CI
          runners ship pnpm but have no fast registry mirror
          configured for the lint/test shards, so ``pnpm install``
          crawls against the public registry and hits the 600s
          timeout — 10 wasted minutes per ``uv sync`` for a bundle
          those jobs never serve. They set this env var to opt out.
        - Skip if the bundle already exists, UNLESS
          ``OMNIGENT_BUILD_WEB_UI=1`` forces a rebuild. This keeps
          repeat ``uv sync`` fast for backend devs (build once, reuse)
          while letting release builds force a fresh bundle.
        - Otherwise the build MUST succeed: a Node.js older than 22.13
          (or absent), a missing pnpm, or a failing ``pnpm install`` /
          ``pnpm --filter web run build`` aborts the install with an
          actionable error. Omnigent needs Node 22 LTS + pnpm at
          runtime anyway (the Claude / Codex / Pi harness CLIs are
          npm packages, and the web UI is a pnpm workspace), so a
          node-less machine would get a broken install either way —
          failing here, with a message that says how to fix it, beats
          a silent API-only install that surfaces later as "the web
          UI doesn't load".

        The pnpm commands run with ``COREPACK_ENABLE_DOWNLOAD_PROMPT=0``
        and no stdin: corepack (whether reached via its ``pnpm`` shim or
        as ``corepack pnpm``) otherwise blocks on an interactive
        confirmation before downloading the pinned pnpm, which a
        non-interactive install can never answer.

        :raises SystemExit: If the on-PATH Node.js is older than 22.13
            (or absent), pnpm is not on PATH (and corepack can't supply
            it), or the web UI build fails, and no skip condition applies.

"""Generate the `omnigent` Homebrew formula for a released PyPI version.

Splices the volatile parts of `Formula/omnigent.rb` — the stable `url`/`sha256`
and every dependency `resource` stanza — into the hand-tuned template
(`omnigent.rb.template`). The structural parts (desc, depends_on, install, test)
are owned by the template; this script owns the bits that change every release.

Resolution: `uv pip compile` computes the exact transitive closure of
`omnigent[<extras>]==<version>` for each target platform (macOS arm + intel by
default — the brew tap's `brew test-bot` matrix). The per-platform closures are
unioned; for each package we then fetch the sdist URL + sha256 from the PyPI JSON
API and emit a `resource` stanza. Every package in the closure must publish an
sdist: the formula builds each resource from source, so one dropped for lack of
an sdist ships a venv missing that dependency, which surfaces as an ImportError
(or a silently disabled feature) at runtime rather than a red build. A missing
sdist is therefore a hard error; `--allow-no-sdist NAME` waives it for a package
omnigent genuinely works without.

Excluded from `resource` generation (provided by the brewed Python environment,
NOT built as virtualenv resources — keep in sync with the template's
`depends_on ... => :no_linkage` and the brewed packages' transitive build deps
like cffi/pycparser, which need libffi that this formula doesn't depend on):
``omnigent`` (the stable url itself) and ``certifi, cryptography, pydantic,
pydantic-core, rpds-py, cffi, pycparser``.

Run by `.github/workflows/homebrew-tap-pr.yml` on `release: published`.

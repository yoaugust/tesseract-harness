# Authorizes a `/merge` slash command by the commenter's repo access.
#
# `/merge` only enables auto-merge / direct-merges an already-mergeable
# PR -- branch protection still blocks red or unreviewed PRs -- so the
# bar is repo write access, not the stricter MAINTAINER set that gates
# the maintainer-only waivers. This keeps `/merge` usable by the whole
# team while blocking outside contributors and drive-by accounts.
#
# The job-level `if` already pre-filters on author_association as a
# cheap first pass; this is the authoritative check, because an org
# MEMBER does not necessarily have write on this specific repo. The
# permission API resolves effective access (team grants, etc.).
#
# Env in: GH_TOKEN, REPO, AUTHOR, PR
# Out:    authorized=true|false on $GITHUB_OUTPUT. On false, posts a
#         reply comment explaining the rejection.

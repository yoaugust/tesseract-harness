# Flags PR changes to security-sensitive paths. Called by
# .github/workflows/security-gate.yml after the trust gate opens.
#
# Two tiers:
#   FAIL  -- paths that let a PR escalate privilege or rewrite the trust model:
#            CI workflows, the maintainer list, code owners. An untrusted
#            author has no business editing these; a real need is unblocked by
#            a maintainer reviewing and merging the change anyway.
#   WARN  -- build/test hooks that execute code at install or collection time
#            (setup.py, pyproject build backends, conftest.py) and the lockfile.
#            Not auto-failed (legit PRs touch them), but surfaced as annotations
#            so a reviewer looks closely. semgrep + the secret scan still run on
#            their contents.
#
# Env in:  CHANGED_FILES (path to a file with one changed path per line).
# Exit:    non-zero if any FAIL-tier path changed; 0 otherwise.

# Decides whether a PR's diff should be put through the Security Scan.
# Called by .github/workflows/security-gate.yml.
#
# We scan UNTRUSTED authors and skip trusted ones. "Trusted" is GitHub's
# native author_association: OWNER / MEMBER / COLLABORATOR -- people with a
# direct relationship to the repo/org -- OR an author in the MAINTAINERS list.
# The list covers maintainers whose org membership is PRIVATE: GitHub only
# reports MEMBER in author_association when membership is public, so a private
# maintainer shows up as CONTRIBUTOR and would otherwise be scanned. Everyone
# else is scanned, INCLUDING returning CONTRIBUTORs (a merged PR in the past
# does not vouch for the contents of this one) and first-timers
# (FIRST_TIME_CONTRIBUTOR / NONE).
#
# This gate decides whether to inspect a PR for attacks and errs toward scanning
# more (it scans returning CONTRIBUTORs, not just first-timers).
#
# author_association is computed by GitHub from the actor's relationship to the
# repo at event time; it is not attacker-settable from PR contents.
#
# Maintainer escape hatch: an untrusted PR can be waived by the
# `skip-security-scan` label alone. Applying a label requires GitHub Triage
# permission (or higher), which a fork author never has, so the label IS the
# maintainer gate and no separate approval is required.
#
# ACCEPTED RISK (repo policy, not GitHub-enforced): GitHub allows the Triage role
# to be granted independently of Write, so in principle a triage-only collaborator
# could self-waive. We accept this because this repo grants Triage only to
# write/admin collaborators -- everyone who can apply the label can already push
# code, so the waiver grants no privilege they don't already have. This invariant
# lives in repo settings, not in code; if Triage is ever granted without Write,
# revisit (e.g. re-add a maintainer-list check). See the PR for the full rationale.
#
# The label is read from the API (trusted), and this script always runs from
# `main`, so a PR cannot edit the decision. The waiver is only evaluated when the
# lookup vars (GH_TOKEN/REPO/PR) are passed (the scan does; the per-workflow
# pollers do not -- they just mirror the scan's result).
#

# Emit the backwards-compat (server, runner) matrices on $GITHUB_OUTPUT as
# `e2e_matrix` and `integration_matrix`.
#
# We test `main` (the checked-out code = client + tests, always) against each
# final (non-prerelease) release tag AT OR ABOVE the backcompat floor (MIN_VERSION, default
# 0.2.0 — the first release with the mock-LLM e2e infra; see below), on BOTH
# axes — and ONLY those cells:
#   (server=main,      runner=<release>)  — new server vs a previously-shipped runner
#   (server=<release>, runner=main)       — previously-shipped server vs new runner/client/tests
# That is the only meaningful cross-version surface. We deliberately do NOT emit
# release×release cells (both sides already shipped together — covered by that
# release's own CI, not a compat signal) nor the all-main cell (== the normal
# e2e gate). So the job count grows linearly (2 per release), not quadratically.
# Integration is the single openai-agents leg (claude-sdk/codex reject the mock
# LLM's "mock-model" — see integration-matrix.sh), one per cell.
#
# Env in:
#   VERSIONS    optional comma-separated override of the version set used for
#               BOTH axes (e.g. "main,v0.2.0"). Empty = main + all final
#               (non-prerelease) tags. Blank entries are dropped and
#               surrounding whitespace trimmed.
#   NUM_SHARDS  e2e shard count per cell (default 4).
# Out (GITHUB_OUTPUT):
#   e2e_matrix={"include":[{"server":..,"runner":..,"shard_id":..,"num_shards":..}, ...]}
#   integration_matrix={"include":[{"server":..,"runner":..,"harness":..,"model":..,"workers":..}, ...]}

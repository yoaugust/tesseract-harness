# Emits the integration-test harness matrix as `matrix=<json>` on $GITHUB_OUTPUT.
#
# Returns an EMPTY matrix ({"include":[]}) to skip: zero jobs, NO check-runs.
# This is the whole reason for the indirection (mirrors e2e-shard-matrix.sh): a
# job-level `if:` skip would instead leave one check-run with an unexpanded
# `Integration (${{ matrix.name }})` name.
#
# Skips only draft PRs. Integration is mock-LLM (no secrets), so fork PRs run
# directly, like CI -- no fork-e2e/** mirror needed.
#
# Single openai-agents leg: all tests now run against the mock LLM server.
# claude-sdk and codex reject "mock-model" as an unknown model (they validate
# against the Databricks model catalog even when mock_llm_base_url is set), so
# only openai-agents works without real credentials. The model name is unused
# in mock mode (model_name fixture returns "mock-model" regardless).
#
# Env in:  EVENT_NAME (github.event_name), IS_DRAFT.
# Out:     matrix={"include":[{"name":..,"harness":..,"model":..,"workers":..}, ...]}
#          (or {"include":[]} when skipped).

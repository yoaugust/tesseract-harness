# Issue prioritization pipeline

This bundle owns the issue-prioritization v2 implementation. The scoring core is
pure and reusable; Databricks and GitHub adapters are layered on top.

## Local dry-run

Prepare normalized issue JSON, then run:

```bash
uv run --project .github/triage_v2 issue-priority \
  --input issues.json \
  --areas .github/areas.json \
  --output-dir /tmp/issue-priority-preview
```

The output directory contains `ranking.json`, `ranking.csv`, `ranking.md`,
`summary.json`, and the exact `config.json` used. This command has no network or
GitHub write path.

All weights and enabled modules live in
`src/issue_prioritization/default_scoring.json`. Readiness and age are present
but disabled by default. Duplicate reach is also disabled until the upstream
triage pipeline exposes confirmed duplicate links as structured data. Community
demand counts GitHub `+1` reactions only, not all reaction types.

## New-issue grading

When `ISSUE_PRIORITIZATION_V2_ENABLED=true`, the Issue Triage workflow sends each
new non-bot issue, including maintainer-authored issues, through V2 only. V2
classifies and prioritizes the issue, completes one-time intake, and uploads a
30-day decision artifact. Setting the switch to `false` restores the untouched
legacy intake as a rollback path.
Legacy `severity:S*` labels are removed instead of replaced with another label.
The periodic Databricks job remains responsible for
the complete ranking and dashboard; the issue-open path does not wait for it.

Configure these repository settings before enabling the switch:

| Setting | Kind | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `DATABRICKS_HOST` | Secret | Workspace URL containing the serving endpoint. |
| `DATABRICKS_CLIENT_ID` | Secret | OAuth service-principal client ID. |
| `DATABRICKS_CLIENT_SECRET` | Secret | OAuth service-principal secret. |
| `ISSUE_PRIORITIZATION_V2_MODEL_ENDPOINT` | Variable | Endpoint name, such as `databricks-gpt-5-6-luna`. |
| `ISSUE_PRIORITIZATION_V2_ENABLED` | Variable | Set to `true` only after the other settings are ready. |

The service principal needs `CAN QUERY` on the endpoint. GitHub supplies the
issue-write token automatically; no GitHub PAT is stored in Actions. Enable v2
last:

```bash
gh secret set DATABRICKS_HOST --repo omnigent-ai/omnigent
gh secret set DATABRICKS_CLIENT_ID --repo omnigent-ai/omnigent
gh secret set DATABRICKS_CLIENT_SECRET --repo omnigent-ai/omnigent
gh variable set ISSUE_PRIORITIZATION_V2_MODEL_ENDPOINT \
  --repo omnigent-ai/omnigent --body databricks-gpt-5-6-luna
gh variable set ISSUE_PRIORITIZATION_V2_ENABLED \
  --repo omnigent-ai/omnigent --body true
```

For a no-write check, export the same Databricks credentials plus
`GITHUB_TOKEN`, then run:

```bash
uv run --frozen --project .github/triage_v2 issue-priority-event \
  --issue-number 2125 \
  --github-repo omnigent-ai/omnigent \
  --model-endpoint databricks-gpt-5-6-luna \
  --areas .github/areas.json \
  --label-manifest .github/issue-prioritization-labels.json \
  --maintainers .github/MAINTAINER \
  --output-dir /tmp/issue-priority-v2 \
  --run-id local-2125 \
  --intake \
  --mode dry_run
```

The output includes the classification, score breakdown, proposed mutations,
proposed bot comment, prompt input hash, and model endpoint, so a later
Databricks importer can consume it without changing the event path.

V2 classifies the issue type from the content independently of the submitted
type label. Its artifacts expose both values and a `type_label_mismatch` flag.
For bugs they also record `evidence_kind`, `information_status`, and the
structured `missing_information` categories. A report can be sufficient without
a reproduction heading when it contains an intermittent observation, controlled
test, diagnostics, or concrete code-path analysis.

On the event path, V2 uses the assessment to keep the Bug, Feature, or Docs
label aligned with the classified content. An incomplete bug receives
`needs-info` and the bot-owned triage comment becomes a request for the specific
missing categories with a seven-day deadline. Author comments and issue-body
edits run the classifier again; sufficient evidence removes `needs-info` and
restores the normal assessment comment. Security issues are excluded from this
lifecycle. Incomplete-issue expiry and high-confidence duplicate closure remain
separate repository-variable gates.

The same reusable V2 workflow handles new issues, body edits, and author
comments. Only a new issue runs intake: it adds `triaged`, removes
`needs-triage`, preserves contributor routing through `help wanted`, assigns an
unassigned report to its maintainer author or the least-loaded classified-area
owner, and checks the prefetched issue corpus for duplicates. Duplicate closure
still requires both high model confidence and the lexical similarity floor, and
assignment happens first. Edits and author comments only reclassify, so they do
not rerun duplicate detection or reshuffle ownership. Author comments are
evaluated with `needs-info` still attached, so a V2 failure cannot strand an
issue by removing it too early.

A daily expiry workflow previews bot-managed `needs-info` deadlines. Set
`ISSUE_TRIAGE_CLOSE_NEEDS_INFO=true` only after reviewing those previews to let
scheduled runs close eligible reports. It closes on the day after the displayed
deadline, requires both Bug and `needs-info`, and excludes security/pinned
issues, untrusted marker comments, and reports with a newer author response. A
later author comment reopens the issue and, while V2 is enabled, runs it again.
Reopening remains available during a V2 rollback so closed reports are not
trapped behind the classifier switch.

## Databricks dry-run

The bundle defines a paused trigger on updates to `github_issues_bronze`. It
waits five minutes after an update and runs at most once per hour. Manual runs
default to `mode=dry_run`:

```bash
databricks bundle validate --strict --target dev --profile <profile>
databricks bundle deploy --target dev --profile <profile>
databricks bundle run issue_prioritization --target dev --profile <profile>
```

The job reads all open issues from `github_issues_bronze`, persists LLM
classifications in `issue_classifications`, appends the ranking to `issue_scores`,
and writes ranking plus proposed label mutations to the managed
`issue_priority_artifacts` volume. Dry-run never changes GitHub issues.
`issue_scores_latest` always exposes the newest complete run for dashboard queries.

The classifier rubric lives in
`src/issue_prioritization/classification_prompt.txt`. After editing it, force a
classifier refresh with a regrade run:

```bash
databricks bundle run issue_prioritization --target dev --profile <profile> \
  --params regrade=true
```

Impact replaces severity as the model's base judgment. Existing cached S0-S3
classifications are mapped to critical/high/medium/low Impact values, so this
migration does not require a full LLM regrade. Legacy S-code and classification
schema compatibility remains for the 0.2.x wheel and is expected to be removed
in 0.3.0 after the label backfill and table migration are complete.

For the one-time migration backfill, first preview comment creation, legacy
severity-label removal, and priority changes whose latest label event came from
a known legacy bot. This needs read credentials but keeps the GitHub write gate
off:

```bash
databricks bundle deploy --target dev --profile <profile> \
  --var="github_secret_scope=<scope>" \
  --var="model_endpoint=<endpoint>"
databricks bundle run issue_prioritization --target dev --profile <profile> \
  --params mode=dry_run,regrade=false,adopt_legacy_bot_priorities=true
```

`run.json` records whether regrade/adoption was enabled and how many historical
priorities were adopted. Human-authored priority events remain blocked in
`mutations.json`. Each mutation also contains the comment body that apply mode
will create or update.

## Dashboard draft

Prepare an idempotent local dashboard draft after a complete scoring run:

```bash
databricks api get /api/2.0/lakeview/dashboards/<dashboard-id> \
  --profile <profile> > /tmp/issue-dashboard.json
uv run --project .github/triage_v2 issue-priority-dashboard-draft \
  --input /tmp/issue-dashboard.json \
  --output /tmp/issue-dashboard-draft.json
```

The draft adds a complete ranking table backed by `issue_scores_latest`. The
command only writes the local output file; it never updates or publishes a
dashboard.

## GitHub apply gate

The table-update trigger is paused. GitHub writes additionally require
`mode=apply`, the deploy variable `allow_github_writes=true`, and a configured
secret scope. The job re-reads every issue's live labels before writing and
preserves maintainer priority overrides. Removing a bot-owned priority is also a
durable override; human-added component labels are never removed. Retired
`severity:S*` labels are always removed because they no longer participate in
scoring.

For scheduled runs, prefer a GitHub App installation token over a personal PAT.
Install the App on `omnigent-ai/omnigent` with metadata read and issues read/write,
then store its client ID and PEM private key. The job discovers the installation
ID from the repository and mints a fresh token for every run:

```bash
printf '%s' "$GITHUB_APP_CLIENT_ID" | databricks secrets put-secret \
  <scope> github-app-client-id --profile <profile>
databricks secrets put-secret \
  <scope> github-app-private-key --profile <profile> < app-private-key.pem
```

The existing `github-token` secret remains a temporary fallback. Secret values
are stripped before use, so a trailing newline from stdin does not become part
of the HTTP authorization header.

Deploy with App authentication while the trigger remains paused, then run a
read-only ownership check. Confirm the run log does not contain the PAT fallback
warning:

```bash
databricks bundle deploy --target dev --profile <profile> \
  --var="model_endpoint=<endpoint>" \
  --var="github_secret_scope=<scope>" \
  --var="github_auth_mode=app" \
  --var="allow_github_writes=true"
databricks bundle run issue_prioritization --target dev --profile <profile> \
  --params mode=dry_run,regrade=false,adopt_legacy_bot_priorities=true
```

After reviewing that run, enable apply-mode table-update runs. Keep legacy
adoption enabled until new-issue artifacts are imported into `issue_bot_state`:

```bash
databricks bundle deploy --target dev --profile <profile> \
  --var="model_endpoint=<endpoint>" \
  --var="github_secret_scope=<scope>" \
  --var="github_auth_mode=app" \
  --var="allow_github_writes=true" \
  --var="scheduled_mode=apply" \
  --var="scheduled_adopt_legacy_bot_priorities=true" \
  --var="schedule_pause_status=UNPAUSED"
```

Defaults remain `token`, `dry_run`, and `PAUSED`, so an ordinary development
deployment cannot silently enable scheduled writes.

```bash
databricks bundle deploy --target dev --profile <profile> \
  --var="allow_github_writes=true" \
  --var="github_secret_scope=<scope>" \
  --var="github_auth_mode=app"
databricks bundle run issue_prioritization --target dev --profile <profile> \
  --params mode=apply,adopt_legacy_bot_priorities=true
```

That apply run is also the comment backfill. The bot finds comments by the
`omnigent-issue-prioritization-v2` marker and updates the existing comment rather
than posting another one. The base score is embedded in HTML metadata for audit
and is not rendered by GitHub; it is hidden, not secret. Visible text contains
the bot assessment, effective priority, the automated recommendation when a
human override is retained, and a concise rationale.

Keep the write variable false until a dry-run's `ranking.*` and
`mutations.json` artifacts have been reviewed. Apply mode also creates any
missing labels declared in `.github/issue-prioritization-labels.json`.

The same repository switch stops legacy intake from writing priority or
component labels. New-issue v2 becomes their owner, and Databricks runs remain
available for ranking and backfills. Event ownership is recorded in
`event.json`, but periodic apply runs preserve those labels until an artifact
importer shares that ownership with `issue_bot_state`.

## Tests

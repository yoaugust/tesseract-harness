// Repo-level reviewer assignment: assign EXACTLY 1 load-balanced reviewer to
// FORK PRs authored by a NON-maintainer, preferring the owners of the area(s)
// the PR touches.
//
// Ownership comes from .github/areas.json (a custom, non-magic path -- NOT
// .github/CODEOWNERS -- so GitHub's native CODEOWNERS auto-request never fires;
// this action is the sole assigner). The candidate pool is the union of owners
// for the PR's changed files; if the PR touches no listed path, it falls back to
// the full set of handles in the file. Maintainers not listed there are never in
// rotation.
//
// An optional prior step may write an LLM area-fit ranking (see
// auto-assign-reviewer.yml); it can only REORDER the candidate pool above (the
// allowlist), and if absent selection is pure load-balancing.
//
// Scope guard: assignment runs only when the PR is from a fork AND the author is
// not in .github/MAINTAINER. Non-fork / collaborator / maintainer PRs are left
// alone (authors pick their own reviewers). Fails closed -- if maintainer status
// can't be determined, it skips rather than risk assigning a maintainer's PR.
//
// "Balance in general": picks are the candidates with the fewest CURRENTLY open
// review requests across the repo (random tie-break) -- stateless fairness.
//
// Only handles drawn from .github/areas.json are ever removed when reconciling,
// so a manually-added reviewer outside that set is left untouched.
//
// Linked-issue sync: the PR's linked ("closes #N") issues are consulted so the
// PR reviewer and the linked-issue assignee stay one and the same person.
//   - If a linked issue is ALREADY assigned to someone in the reviewers pool,
//     that person is adopted as the PR reviewer (overriding the load-balanced
//     area pick) -- "the person who owns the issue reviews the fix".
//   - Whoever ends up the reviewer is then assigned onto any linked issue that
//     has NO assignee yet, so an unowned issue inherits the PR's reviewer.
// The workflow also fires on `edited` so a `closes #N` link added AFTER open
// (e.g. a PR opened with a stub body, then filled in) is not missed. On an
// `edited` event the action is PROMOTE-ONLY: it adopts a linked-issue assignee
// if there now is one, and otherwise leaves the existing pick untouched -- it
// won't re-run the load-balanced fallback on top of a chosen reviewer, so an
// unrelated edit can't thrash it. The one exception: if the PR has NO managed
// reviewer yet (the `opened` run may have been cancelled mid-assignment by this
// edit under cancel-in-progress), the edit DOES fall through to the pick, so a
// PR is never left unassigned. See the guard in the body.
// Adoption is restricted to the managed reviewers pool (not the wider MAINTAINER
// set) so an adopted reviewer is always removable by the reconcile step -- a
// MAINTAINER not in the pool would be unremovable and could break the "exactly
// 1 reviewer" invariant on a reopen. The push-down direction assigns regardless,
// capped at MAX_PUSHDOWN issues since the fork-author-controlled PR body chooses
// the linked issues. Existing divergences on already-assigned issues are left
// untouched. Needs issues:write (see auto-assign-reviewer.yml) to assign the
// linked issue.

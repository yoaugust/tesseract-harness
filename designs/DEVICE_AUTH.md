# Delegated Auth — Device Authorization Grant (RFC 8628)

> **IMPLEMENTED.**
>
> A generic, client-agnostic delegated-login mechanism. Slack is the first
> consumer (`integrations/slack/`), but the server side carries no
> Slack-specific concepts — the requesting application names itself with the
> RFC 8628 `client_id` (a public string like `"slack"`; display/audit only).
> It is a public OAuth client by default (no client secret), with an
> **optional** shared secret (`OMNIGENT_DEVICE_CLIENT_SECRET`) that gates the
> client-facing endpoints when set — see the phishing mitigations below.

## Problem

The Slack integration (`integrations/slack/`) is a standalone Socket-Mode
process that calls each user's Omnigent server over HTTP + SSE
(`OmnigentClient` / `OmnigentClientPool`). Each Slack user's turns must reach
the Omnigent server **as that user's own authenticated identity** — so the
server can scope permissions and audit who did what — **without the Slack
process ever handling the user's Omnigent credentials**. An unauthenticated
client can only reach auth-disabled servers, and would present one shared
anonymous identity the server can't distinguish per user.

## Topology and trust

```
  omnigent server   <->   slack socket server   <->   slack.com   <->   user
  (Auth + Resource        (OAuth client /             (transport)      (browser =
   Server)                 "device")                                    Resource Owner)
```

Slack relays all messages between the user and the socket server, so **no
Omnigent credential may pass through Slack**. The user authenticates directly
against the Omnigent server in their own browser, out of band. This is exactly
the shape of the **OAuth 2.0 Device Authorization Grant (RFC 8628)**: a device
that cannot host a browser obtains a code, the user approves out-of-band, and
the device polls for a token.

Role mapping:

| RFC 8628 role            | Here                                            |
|--------------------------|-------------------------------------------------|
| Authorization Server     | Omnigent server (`/oauth/device/*`, `/oauth/token`) |
| Resource Server          | Omnigent server (existing `/v1/**` APIs)        |
| Client / "device"        | Slack socket server                             |
| Resource Owner           | The Slack user, authenticating in their browser |
| Out-of-band channel      | Slack (delivers the verification link only)     |

## Shared substrate (reused, not rebuilt)

The device grant builds on existing server primitives:

- **Atomic single-use token redemption** — `SqlAlchemyAccountStore.redeem_token`
  uses `UPDATE … WHERE redeemed_at IS NULL` + rowcount so at most one caller
  wins under concurrency (`accounts_store.py`). The grant store follows the
  same pattern.
- **Session JWT minting** — `mint_session_token(user_id, secret, ttl, provider)`
  (`oidc.py`), HS256 with `sub`/`iat`/`exp`/`provider`.
- **Bearer validation** — `UnifiedAuthProvider._check_cookie` accepts
  `Authorization: Bearer <jwt>` and validates the same claim shape
  (`auth.py`). Delegated access tokens validate through this path unchanged.
- **Browser consent under accounts mode** — the `accounts` provider
  establishes the browser identity via its session cookie; the consent page
  runs behind it. (This is why the grant mounts in accounts mode only — see
  the mount restriction below.)
- **Open-redirect hardening** — `_sanitize_return_to` (`routes/auth.py`) guards
  the post-login bounce back to the consent page.

## Design decisions (agreed)

1. **Public by default, optional client secret.** The baseline boundary is
   the secret `device_code` the client holds, the ephemeral verification
   link, and authenticated in-browser consent; initiation is per-IP
   rate-limited and nothing is granted until a real user approves. On top of
   that, setting `OMNIGENT_DEVICE_CLIENT_SECRET` on the server gates the
   **client-facing** endpoints (authorize / token / revoke) behind a shared
   secret header (`X-Omnigent-Client-Secret`, constant-time compared), so
   only an authorized client can drive the flow. The **browser** endpoints
   (consent GET / approve / deny) are never gated by it — the user's browser
   doesn't hold the secret; their trust is the session cookie + Origin check.
   Unset ⇒ endpoints stay public (backward compatible). Shipping the secret to
   the Slack client is safe because its target is a **fixed operator config**
   (`OMNIGENT_SERVER_URL`), not a user-supplied URL, so the secret only ever
   travels to the trusted server.
2. **Refresh tokens** — short-lived access tokens (≤ 1 h) plus a rotating,
   revocable refresh token, with a 30-day absolute grant lifetime. The Slack
   server refreshes silently; a stolen access token expires quickly and a grant
   can be killed centrally or ages out on its own.

## Flow

```
 1. A Slack user opens the `/omnigent` setup modal against an
       accounts-mode server; the modal detects auth is required and starts
       the device flow (there is no separate login command).

 2. Slack server ─ POST /oauth/device/authorize ─────────────▶ Omnigent
       body: { client_id }        # public app name, e.g. "slack"
    Omnigent ─────────────────────────────────────────────────▶ Slack server
       { device_code,            # secret, HELD BY SLACK SERVER ONLY
         user_code,              # short, human-readable
         verification_uri,       # e.g. https://srv/oauth/device
         verification_uri_complete,   # verification_uri?user_code=XYZ
         expires_in: 600, interval: 5 }

 3. Slack server shows the verification link (verification_uri_complete,
       code prefilled for one-click) in the setup modal (initiator only),
       plus the user_code so the user can confirm the match. The
       device_code is NOT included — it never leaves the server pair.

 4. User clicks → Omnigent consent page (verification_uri).
       The page REQUIRES a login started for THIS flow: if the browser's
       session predates the grant (session iat < grant.created_at), it
       bounces through the login page with ?reauth=1 — which forces a fresh
       password entry even for an already-signed-in user — and returns here.
       Once re-authenticated, the page shows: "<client_id> is requesting
       permission to act as YOU (alice@example.com) on this Omnigent server.
       [Approve] [Deny]" plus a warning to approve only a self-started login.
       The forced re-auth means a grant can't be approved by one reflexive
       click on a link the user didn't personally start (see threat #2).

 5. User approves → the grant is bound to the authenticated identity
       (alice@…). client_id is recorded for display/audit only, never as
       an authorization key.

 6. Slack server polls ─ POST /oauth/token ──────────────────▶ Omnigent
       grant_type=urn:ietf:params:oauth:grant-type:device_code
       { device_code }
    Responses: 400 authorization_pending | 429 slow_down |
               400 expired_token | 400 access_denied |
               400 invalid_grant |
               200 { access_token, refresh_token, expires_in, token_type }

 7. Slack server stores  (team_id, slack_user_id, server_url)
       → { access_token, refresh_token }  ENCRYPTED AT REST,
       and attaches  Authorization: Bearer <access_token>  on every
       request for that user thereafter.

 8. On 401 / near-expiry: POST /oauth/token grant_type=refresh_token →
       new access + rotated refresh.  On refresh failure (revoked/expired):
       drop tokens and re-prompt login in the setup modal.
```

The Slack `(team_id, slack_user_id)` → identity mapping lives entirely on
the Slack side (step 7). The server-side grant is client-agnostic: it
knows only the RFC 8628 `client_id` and the Omnigent identity that
approved it.

## Server-side changes

### Router `omnigent/server/routes/device_auth.py`

The RFC 8628 consent surface (`/oauth/device/*`) is mounted in `app.py`
only when **`OMNIGENT_DEVICE_GRANT_ENABLED` is truthy** (opt-in,
**default-off**), and then **only in `accounts` mode** (the in-browser
consent needs the accounts login page; header mode has no server-mintable
identity — see `create_device_auth_router`, which raises if constructed for
any other source). The token/revoke half is factored into
`create_oauth_token_router` and mounts **unconditionally** in both accounts
and OIDC modes — login-issued refresh grants need `/oauth/token` even where
the device flow is off; a standalone mount refuses the `device_code` grant
type with `unsupported_grant_type`. The `device_grants` table is created
unconditionally by the migration regardless of the flag; only the consent
mount is gated. This router also **owns** `mint_delegated_token` and
`DELEGATED_SCOPE` (moved here from `oidc.py`, which retains only
`mint_session_token` / `mint_session_cookie`).

- `POST /oauth/device/authorize` — **public** (rate-limited). Generates a
  high-entropy `device_code` (`secrets.token_urlsafe`, stored **hashed**), a
  short `user_code`, `expires_in`, `interval`. Persists a `pending` grant
  carrying only the public `client_id`. Returns the RFC 8628 authorize
  response. Opportunistically purges expired grants (no scheduler).
- `GET /oauth/device` — the consent page (`verification_uri`). Requires a
  browser identity via the active provider; if unauthenticated, bounce through
  the provider's normal login and return here (`_sanitize_return_to`). Prefills
  `user_code` from `verification_uri_complete`.
- `POST /oauth/device/approve` / `POST /oauth/device/deny` — authenticated
  browser actions, CSRF-gated by `_require_browser_origin` (rejects a missing
  Origin). `approve` binds the grant to the authenticated `user_id` (`sub`),
  stamps `approved_at` (the absolute-lifetime clock), and flips status to
  `approved`; `deny` flips to `denied`.
- `POST /oauth/token`:
  - `grant_type=…:device_code` — look up by hashed `device_code`; return
    `authorization_pending` / `slow_down` (interval enforcement) /
    `expired_token` / `access_denied` / `invalid_grant`, or on approval mint an
    **access token** (`mint_delegated_token`, TTL ≤ 1 h) + **refresh token** and
    return them. Single-use: an atomic `approved → redeemed` transition means
    the device_code cannot be exchanged twice.
  - `grant_type=refresh_token` — validate the presented refresh token against
    the stored hash, **rotate** it (issue new, invalidate old), mint a new
    access token. Refuses rotation past the 30-day absolute lifetime
    (`expired_token`). **Reuse detection**: presenting an already-rotated
    refresh token revokes the whole grant (token-theft signal).
- `POST /oauth/revoke` — revoke a grant: null the refresh token, mark revoked
  (the `grant_id` then reads as revoked in the denylist check). Accepts a
  `refresh_token`, or falls back to the `grant_id` on the caller's own bearer
  so a client holding only its access token can still log out. Idempotent.
  Backs `/omnigent logout`.

### New store `omnigent/server/device_grant_store.py`

Modeled on `SqlAlchemyAccountStore` — workspace-scoped, secrets stored hashed,
atomic single-use redemption, `purge_expired`. New table `device_grants`:

| column               | notes                                              |
|----------------------|----------------------------------------------------|
| `id` (grant id)      | PK with `workspace_id`                             |
| `device_code_hash`   | HMAC/SHA-256 of the device_code; never store raw   |
| `user_code`          | short code shown/typed by the user                 |
| `client_id`          | RFC 8628 client id — the requesting application (e.g. `slack`); display + audit |
| `status`             | `pending` / `approved` / `denied` / `redeemed` / `revoked` |
| `user_id`            | bound Omnigent identity, set at approval           |
| `refresh_token_hash` / `prev_refresh_token_hash` | current + prior digest (rotation + reuse detection) |
| `created_at` / `expires_at` / `approved_at` / `last_polled_at` | TTL, absolute-lifetime clock, `slow_down` timing |

### Token claims and validation (`auth.py`, `device_auth.py`)

Delegated access tokens (minted by `mint_delegated_token`) keep the existing
HS256 shape (so `_check_cookie` accepts them) plus four delegated-only claims:

- `act` — provenance, RFC 8693-style: `{ "client_id": "slack" }`, naming the
  application that obtained the grant so every delegated action is attributable
  to it.
- `scope` — set to `DELEGATED_SCOPE` (`"sessions"`). The auth layer's
  fail-closed allowlist `delegated_path_allowed` restricts a token carrying
  this scope to `/health`, `/v1/agents`, `/v1/hosts`, `/v1/sessions`,
  `/v1/runners`, `/oauth/token`, `/oauth/revoke` (exact or `prefix/…`);
  everything else — including admin / user-management (`/auth/users*`, invites,
  setup) — is rejected.
- `grant_id` — checked against the revoked-grant denylist (`is_revoked`, wired
  via `set_grant_revocation_check`) on **every** request for a delegated token,
  so revoking the grant kills the token immediately. Delegated tokens carrying
  a `grant_id` skip the credential cache (they return before the cache write),
  keeping the per-request revocation check honest without making ordinary
  (non-delegated) sessions stateful. Fail-closed: an unknown `grant_id` reads
  as revoked.
- `jti` — unique token id for audit/log correlation (not a revocation key;
  revocation is grant-scoped, not per-token).

## Slack-side changes

- **`oauth.py`** — device-authorize → post ephemeral link → poll token
  endpoint (respecting `interval` / `slow_down`) → store tokens.
- **`omnigent.py`** — attach `Authorization: Bearer` per
  `(server_url, slack_user_id)`; on 401, refresh once and retry; on refresh
  failure, surface a re-login prompt. `OmnigentClientPool` keys clients by
  `(server_url, slack_user_id)` instead of `server_url` alone.
- **`store.py`** — new `oauth_tokens` table `(team_id, user_id, server_url)` →
  access/refresh **encrypted at rest** (key from env / secret manager, never in
  the DB). `/omnigent logout` → `POST /oauth/revoke` + local delete.
- **`setup.py`** — validation uses the user's token, so auth-enabled servers
  are supported.
- **`config.py`** — holds the local encryption key for token storage.

## Security analysis

| # | Threat | Mitigation |
|---|--------|-----------|
| 1 | `device_code` leak → token theft | Never transits Slack or the user — only `verification_uri_complete` (a `user_code`) does. Stored hashed; single-use. |
| 2 | Link misdelivery / phishing another user | Link shown to the initiator only (in their own setup modal). **Consent requires a login started FOR this flow: the consent page rejects a session whose `iat` predates the grant and bounces through the login page with `reauth=1`, forcing a fresh password entry even for an already-signed-in user.** So an attacker-initiated flow can't be approved by a single reflexive click — the victim must deliberately re-enter their password against a screen naming the exact Omnigent identity and requesting `client_id`. The gate is enforced on both the consent GET and the approve POST. |
| 3 | Anyone can initiate/poll (public client) | Cheap `pending` state grants nothing until an authenticated user approves. `POST /oauth/device/authorize` is rate-limited per client IP (10/60s → 429 `slow_down`); short (10 min) `device_code` expiry; `slow_down` enforced server-side on aggressive polling; expired grants purged opportunistically. |
| 4 | Slack SQLite exfiltration → mass impersonation | Tokens **encrypted at rest**; access tokens short-lived (≤ 1 h); refresh tokens revocable. Bounded, centrally killable window. |
| 5 | Compromised Slack server acts as all users (inherent to delegation) | Reduced scope (no admin), short TTL + refresh rotation, per-grant revocation, **absolute grant lifetime (30 d) enforced on refresh** so even an un-revoked grant dies, and an `act`-claim audit trail. |
| 6 | Confused deputy — user A's token used for user B | On the Slack side, token lookup is strictly keyed by acting `slack_user_id`; the thread `owner_user_id` gate drops non-owner follow-ups (`service.py`). |
| 7 | Stale/leaked delegated token can't be revoked | Per-grant `grant_id` revocation denylist (`is_revoked`, checked every request) makes delegated-token revocation immediate — closes today's stateless-JWT gap for these higher-value tokens. |
| 8 | Refresh-token theft | Rotation on every use + **reuse detection**: the just-superseded token's digest is retained in `prev_refresh_token_hash`; presenting it (a replay) is recognised and revokes the whole grant, killing the attacker's freshly-rotated token too. |
| 9 | Transport interception | Require HTTPS for `verification_uri` and all token/bearer traffic; refuse the flow over plaintext except localhost dev. |
| 10 | Open redirect on the consent login bounce | Reuse `_sanitize_return_to` (OIDC, `routes/auth.py`) / `sanitizeReturnTo` (accounts SPA). Verified both providers reject absolute / `//` targets. |
| 11 | CSRF on approve/deny if `SameSite=none` is ever enabled | `_require_browser_origin` rejects a **missing** `Origin` on approve/deny (stricter than the shared `require_trusted_origin`, which fail-opens for non-browser clients). These routes are browser-only, so the CSRF defense no longer depends on the cookie's `SameSite`. |

### Device-code phishing — accepted risk, mitigated in depth

The canonical RFC 8628 risk: a stranger initiates a flow and tricks a victim
Omnigent user into approving the verification link, binding the grant to the
*victim's* identity while the attacker (holding the `device_code`) polls for the
token.

When no client secret is configured the endpoints are **public**, so
initiation is open — the defense is layered, not a gate:

- **Forced re-authentication at consent.** Consent requires a login started for
  THIS flow: the consent page (and the approve POST) reject a session whose
  `iat` predates the grant's `created_at` and bounce through the login page with
  `reauth=1`, which forces a fresh password entry even for an already-signed-in
  user. This defeats the reflex-approve variant of the attack — a victim handed a
  one-click link (even one with the code prefilled) still can't bind the grant
  without deliberately re-entering their password against a screen naming the
  exact identity and client. (`device_auth.py` `_session_iat` + the
  `reauth=1` bounce; `LoginPage.tsx` suppresses its already-signed-in
  auto-return under `reauth=1`.) The prefilled one-click link is therefore
  retained for convenience — the re-auth step, not code handling, is the gate.
- The consent page prominently **warns** the user to approve only a login they
  personally started and to match the code shown by the application.
- The delegated scope excludes admin / user-management endpoints.
- The grant has a 30-day absolute lifetime and is revocable; a leaked/phished
  grant self-expires even if never revoked.
- Initiation is rate-limited per IP; nothing is granted until a real user
  authenticates and approves in their own browser.
- **Startup warning.** When the grant is mounted on a multi-user (accounts)
  server with `OMNIGENT_DEVICE_CLIENT_SECRET` unset, the server logs a loud
  warning at startup that the authorize endpoint is public — nudging the
  operator to opt into the secret rather than leaving initiation open unknowingly
  (`app.py`, at the device-router mount).

Setting `OMNIGENT_DEVICE_CLIENT_SECRET` closes initiation entirely to
unauthorized callers: without the matching `X-Omnigent-Client-Secret` header,
authorize / token / revoke return `401 invalid_client` before anything is
created, so only the operator's own client (which holds the secret) can even
start a flow. This is now shippable to the Slack client because its server
target is a fixed operator config, not a user-supplied URL — the secret only
ever travels to the trusted server. The consent-page warning, short TTL, and
absolute lifetime remain the defenses when the secret is left unset.

### Deliberate deviation from the current model

Ordinary Omnigent session JWTs are stateless and unrevocable today (revocation =
cookie deletion + expiry). Delegated tokens are higher-value — one server acts
for many users — so this design makes **delegated** tokens revocable (persisted
grant + per-`grant_id` revocation check) while leaving normal sessions
stateless. This added invariant is the main thing for reviewers to scrutinize.

## Out of scope / follow-ups

- Admin UI for listing and revoking active Slack delegations.
- Multi-replica rate limiting: the authorize throttle is in-process; a
  horizontally-scaled server would want a shared store (the grant table's
  single-use/expiry semantics already bound abuse in the meantime).
- Applying the same delegated grant to other non-browser clients (the CLI could
  use it too, superseding the in-memory `_cli_tickets` store).
- Per-scope consent granularity beyond the single "session APIs, no admin" scope.

## Login-issued refresh grants

The fix for unattended hosts dying at session-JWT expiry (a host
authenticated via `omnigent login` previously had **no renewal path** —
the stored `{token, user_id, expires_at}` record simply lapsed, default
8 h, and the next tunnel reconnect got a misleading 403).

- **Issuance** — both interactive login flows create a grant born
  `redeemed` (`DeviceGrantStore.create_redeemed_grant`; the interactive
  login *is* the consent step, so no device-code dance): the OIDC
  cli-ticket fulfillment always, and accounts `POST /auth/login` when the
  body carries `issue_refresh: true` (sent by the CLI, never the web
  form — a browser must not receive refresh material). The raw refresh
  token rides back once (`/auth/cli-poll` / the login response) as an
  optional `refresh_token` key — old CLIs ignore it, new CLIs against old
  servers see it absent. `client_id` is `"omnigent-cli"`.
- **Authority** — a refreshed login-grant token carries `grant_id` (so
  revocation still kills it) but **no `scope` claim**, so the delegated
  path allowlist does not apply: it renews the session JWT and keeps that
  same authority. Scoping it like a third-party device grant instead made
  every non-allowlisted route (`/v1/usage`, `/v1/scheduled-tasks`,
  `/v1/policy-registry`) 401 after the first refresh. `LOGIN_GRANT_CLIENT_ID`
  is the marker and is **reserved** — `/oauth/device/authorize` refuses a
  request naming it, so a device client cannot self-declare into this class.
- **No rotation** — login grants return the SAME refresh token on every
  renewal. Rotation + reuse detection is right for a browser-adjacent
  third-party client, but for an unattended host it turns any ambiguous
  network failure (lost response, crash between the server committing and
  the client persisting) into a permanently revoked grant. Only the
  short-lived access token is renewed; revocation and the absolute lifetime
  cap still bound exposure. Device grants keep rotating.
- **Renewal** — `omnigent.cli_auth.refresh_stored_token` POSTs
  `grant_type=refresh_token`, persists the result, and returns the
  fresh access token. The runner/host auth-token factory
  calls it when the stored token lapses, and the host tunnel rebuilds
  headers through that factory on every reconnect — so an unattended
  host renews itself for the grant's lifetime. Refreshes on one machine
  are serialized by an advisory file lock with a re-check after acquire,
  so a losing racer picks up the winner's rotated pair instead of
  replaying the stale token (which reuse detection would punish by
  revoking the grant).
- **One grant per host replica (recommended)** — since login grants do
  not rotate, N replicas sharing one token file no longer revoke each
  other. A per-replica login is still preferred so a single host can be
  revoked without cutting off the rest.
- **Lifetime** — the absolute grant lifetime stays 30 days by default;
  `OMNIGENT_GRANT_MAX_LIFETIME_DAYS` lets an operator extend it
  deliberately for long-lived unattended hosts. Invalid values fall back
  to the default (never fail open to unbounded).
- **Client-secret interaction** — `OMNIGENT_DEVICE_CLIENT_SECRET` gates
  the endpoints that mint from an ephemeral code (device authorize + the
  `device_code` exchange). Refresh and revoke are NOT gated: the presented
  refresh/access token is itself the credential, and a CLI renewing its own
  login has no way to carry that secret (gating it made every automatic
  refresh 401 in a Slack-serving deployment).
- **Housekeeping** — `/oauth/token` opportunistically purges expired and
  aged-out grants. The device flow purges on `authorize`, which a
  standalone token-router mount does not have, so login-grant rows would
  otherwise accumulate one per login.

### Known limitation

General CLI commands (`omnigent usage`, session commands, direct
remote-URL chat) still read the stored token without attempting a refresh —
only the host/runner auth-token factory renews today. An expired login with
valid refresh material therefore leaves those commands unauthenticated
until something on the host path renews the shared file. Wiring the
remaining CLI entrypoints is follow-up work.

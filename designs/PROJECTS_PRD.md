# PRD: Projects

- Status: Draft
- Author: Serena Ruan
- Related: [`designs/SESSION_PROJECTS_SIDEBAR.md`](./SESSION_PROJECTS_SIDEBAR.md) (v1, label-based sidebar grouping), issue [#863](https://github.com/omnigent-ai/omnigent/issues/863), PR [#869](https://github.com/omnigent-ai/omnigent/pull/869)

## 1. Overview

A **Project** is a user-defined container that groups related sessions and
carries owner-private configuration (memory, context, a default working
directory). It gives users a durable "workspace" above the single session, so
recurring work isn't re-configured each time or scattered across a flat list.

This PRD scopes the **full vision**. A **v1** already exists (§4): projects as a
reserved `omni_project` label, grouped in the sidebar — this covers grouping
only. Everything else (empty projects, rename/reorder, memory/context/defaults)
requires promoting Project from a *label* to a *first-class entity*.

Two decisions shape the whole design and are worth stating up front:
- **A project is owner-private metadata.** Sharing stays **per-session** exactly
  as it is today; there is **no project-level ACL** (§9).
- **Memory & context are owner-private** and never cross to a shared session's
  recipient. A shared session appears **ungrouped** to the recipient (§9).

## 2. Summary — what we support & UX impact

Priority order (highest first), per product direction:

| # | Capability | Support? | Mechanism | UX impact |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | **Create empty project** | ✅ | first-class `projects` table (needed for empty) | Always-visible **Projects** section in the sidebar; "New project" creates one with zero sessions |
| 2 | **Move session in / create session in project** | ✅ | `project_id` FK on session | Session-row kebab "Add to / Move / Remove from project"; "New session here" from a project header, pre-filling its defaults |
| 3 | **Rename projects** | ✅ | `PATCH /projects/{id}` on `name` (members untouched) | Inline rename from the project header |
| 4a | **Default working dir / host / harness** | ✅ (soft hints) | default columns on project | "New session here" pre-fills the new-chat dialog; unsatisfiable hints (host offline / not owned) are silently dropped |
| 4b | **Project memory** (owner-private) | ✅ | DB-backed, scoped to project, host-agnostic | Agent accumulates learnings across the project's sessions; never exposed to shared-session recipients |
| 4c | **Project context** (owner-private) | ✅ | curated docs/instructions attached to project | Owner-curated inputs seed each session started in the project |
| 5 | **Project-level sharing / ACL** | ❌ intentional | — | Sharing stays **per-session** (existing ACL). A shared session appears **ungrouped** in the recipient's "Shared with me" — no project, no memory/context |
| opt | **Reorder projects** | 🔵 optional | client-only (localStorage, no DB column) | Drag-to-reorder in the sidebar; nice-to-have, not required for launch — see §7.2 |

**Two-line model:**
- Project = **owner-private organizer** carrying defaults + memory + context.
- Sharing = **per-session only**; a shared session crosses the ACL boundary, its
  project membership and memory/context do **not**.

## 3. Where we are today (grounding)

The exploration of the current codebase established the following, which every
requirement below builds on:

- **Session = `Conversation`** (`omnigent/entities/conversation.py`). Key fields:
  `id`, `title`, `runner_id`, `host_id`, `workspace` (absolute path, **immutable
  after creation**), `git_branch`, `model_override`, `reasoning_effort`,
  `harness_override`, `cost_control_mode_override`, `labels`, `session_state`,
  `archived`.
- **Session creation** goes through `POST /v1/sessions`
  (`SessionCreateRequest`, `omnigent/server/schemas.py`) with `agent_id`,
  `host_type` (`external` | `managed`), `host_id`, `workspace`, optional `git`
  worktree spec, and per-session overrides. UX lives in
  `web/src/shell/NewChatDialog.tsx`.
- **Working directory & host**: `workspace` is a path on a `host` (a machine
  running `omnigent host`, or a server-managed sandbox). Bound at creation,
  immutable thereafter. Git worktrees are opt-in at create time.
- **Memory/context today**: only `session_state` (per-session key/value for
  policy callables) and `session_usage`. There is **no cross-session or
  project-level memory** and no shared context store.
- **Permissions**: per-`(user_id, conversation_id)` rows with levels
  read(1)/edit(2)/manage(3)/owner(4) (`omnigent/db/db_models.py`,
  `omnigent/entities/permission.py`). `__public__` sentinel grants public read.
  No org/team model. `workspace_id` is a multi-tenancy partition key, not a
  user-facing grouping.
- **Projects v1 already exists**: reserved label `omni_project` in
  `conversation_labels`; endpoints `GET /v1/sessions/projects` and
  `?project=<name>` filtering; `useProjects()` / `useMoveToProject()` hooks;
  sidebar grouping. Projects are **implicit** — a project exists iff a
  non-archived session references it, and vanishes when its last member leaves.
  **There is no project row, so a project cannot be empty, renamed, or carry its
  own config.**

## 4. Key architectural decision: implicit label vs. first-class entity

This is the foundational decision. Every requirement below except plain grouping
requires promoting Project from a label to a first-class entity.

| Capability | Implicit label (v1 today) | First-class entity (this PRD) |
|---|---|---|
| Group sessions | ✅ | ✅ |
| Empty project | ❌ (project = its members) | ✅ |
| Rename (cheap, safe) | ❌ (rewrite every member) | ✅ (rename the row) |
| Project defaults (dir/host/model) | ❌ nowhere to store | ✅ (columns on project) |
| Project memory/context | ❌ nowhere to attach | ✅ (FK to project) |
| DB migration required | ❌ none | ✅ new table + backfill |

**Recommendation:** ship v1 (labels) for grouping now, then **promote to a
first-class `projects` entity** as the foundation for the rest.
Migration: create `projects` rows from the distinct `omni_project` label values
per owner, point sessions at `project_id`, retire the label. This is a one-time
backfill, not user-visible.

Proposed model, referenced throughout:
- New `projects` table: `id`, `workspace_id`, `name`, `owner`, `created_at`,
  `updated_at`, plus the config columns from §8. (No `position` column —
  reorder is deferred and client-only, §7.2.)
- Session→project membership = nullable `project_id` FK on conversation
  metadata. `null` = unfiled. FK (over label-of-id) is cleaner for renames and
  referential integrity.
- CRUD endpoints: `POST /v1/projects`, `GET /v1/projects`,
  `PATCH /v1/projects/{id}`, `DELETE /v1/projects/{id}`.

## 5. Priority 1 — Create empty project

### 5.1 What
Create a project with **zero sessions**, then fill it later.

### 5.2 Why this needs a first-class entity
Under the implicit-label model a project *is* its set of member sessions — an
empty project has no rows and therefore does not exist. Supporting empty
projects **requires the `projects` table** from §4.

### 5.3 UX
- The sidebar always shows a **Projects** section, even with zero projects, so
  the create-empty-then-fill flow is discoverable (not a hidden label action).
- "New project" creates a named, empty project (`POST /v1/projects`).
- **Deletion:** deleting a project with members prompts — (a) delete the project
  and unfile its sessions (sessions kept) or (b) block until empty. **Proposed:
  (a)** with confirmation. Never cascade-delete sessions. This replaces v1's
  "archive all members to make the project vanish" behavior.

### 5.4 Why ship empty-project creation first

It's the right first slice — not just because it's P1, but because it's the
**minimal change that forces the first-class entity**, which everything else
builds on for free. An empty project is definitionally impossible under the v1
label model (a label-project *is* its members), so "create empty project" *is*
the `projects` table + the `project_id` membership column. Once those exist,
move/rename/reorder/defaults are small additions on the same schema.

Phase 1 is therefore exactly two schema changes: a new `projects` table, and a
`project_id` column on the conversation metadata row. Config/memory/context
columns (§8) are **deferred to Phase 2/3** — start with a lean table so Phase 1
stays small and reversible.

### 5.5 Proposed Phase-1 schema

Follows the repo's conventions from the most recent table (`scheduled_tasks`,
migration `z6…`, `omnigent/db/db_models.py`): `workspace_id` leads the PK, **no
DB foreign keys** (schema Rule R032 — relationships enforced in the app), owner
scoping via a `*_user_id` column, epoch-seconds timestamps.

```python
class SqlProject(OmnigentBase):
    """A user-defined, owner-private container that groups sessions."""
    __tablename__ = "projects"

    workspace_id: Mapped[int] = mapped_column(
        BigInteger, primary_key=True, nullable=False,
        server_default="0", default=current_workspace_id,
    )
    # "proj_"-prefixed string id (not Uuid16) so it reads as a sibling of
    # conversation ids and lives naturally in the metadata String column.
    id: Mapped[str] = mapped_column(String(64), primary_key=True)
    name: Mapped[str] = mapped_column(String(256), nullable=False)
    # Owner stamped on the row (like scheduled_tasks), NOT derived from a
    # permission table the way session ownership is. Correct here precisely
    # because projects have no ACL and are owner-private (§9) — see the
    # "Where ownership lives" note below. None in single-user/OSS mode.
    user_id: Mapped[str | None] = mapped_column(String(128), nullable=True)
    created_at: Mapped[int] = mapped_column(Integer, nullable=False)
    updated_at: Mapped[int | None] = mapped_column(Integer, nullable=True)
    # No `position` column: ordering is deferred and, when added, will be a
    # client-only concern (localStorage), not server state — see §7.2.

    __table_args__ = (
        # "list my projects": prefix scan on (workspace_id, owner). Server
        # returns a stable order (e.g. created_at / name); the client may
        # re-order locally.
        Index("ix_projects_owner", "workspace_id", "user_id", "id"),
        # Per-owner name uniqueness (§7.1) is a store-level check
        # (`_name_taken`), not a unique index — see the table below.
    )
```

Membership is one nullable column on the existing metadata table
(`SqlConversationMetadata`, `omnigent_conversation_metadata`):

```python
# Relates to projects.id; no DB FK (Rule R032). NULL = unfiled.
project_id: Mapped[str | None] = mapped_column(String(64), nullable=True)
# In __table_args__ — "list sessions in project X" + counts (GROUP BY project_id):
Index("ix_conversation_metadata_project_id", "workspace_id", "project_id", "id"),
```

**Column decisions worth sign-off:**

| Choice | Proposed | Rationale / alternative |
|---|---|---|
| `id` type | `String(64)`, `proj_`-prefixed | Reads as a sibling of `conv_…` ids; lives in the metadata String column. Newest tables use `Uuid16` — diverge here for readability + column symmetry. |
| Membership location | `project_id` on `omnigent_conversation_metadata` | Metadata already holds host/workspace/runner; `list_conversations` can filter it inline. |
| Name uniqueness | store-level check, **no** unique index | Matches §7.1; case-sensitivity still open (Q3). The unique index shipped in Phase 1a and was dropped in `d5e6f7a8b9c0`: it never held for single-user mode (NULL owner, and SQL treats NULLs as distinct), and `name` is mutable, so it was maintained on every rename. Concurrent creates/renames to one name can now both land. |
| Ownership | `user_id` **column on the row** | See "Where ownership lives" below — differs from sessions on purpose. |
| Ordering | **no `position` column** | Reorder is deferred and client-only (§7.2); no server state until proven needed. |
| Deferred columns | default host/workspace/harness/model, memory/context refs | Added in Phase 2/3, not now. |

**Where ownership lives (why a column, not the permission table).** The repo has
two ownership conventions, and which is correct depends on whether the entity is
shareable:

- **Sessions** have *no* owner column — ownership is derived from
  `session_permissions` as the `LEVEL_OWNER` grantee (`get_session_owner`,
  `list_projects(owned_by=...)`). This is required *because sessions are shared*:
  ownership is just the top row among many `(user, level)` grants.
- **`scheduled_tasks`** — a personal, non-shareable artifact with no ACL — instead
  stamps `user_id` directly on the row (`db_models.py:1298`), indexed
  `(workspace_id, user_id, id)`.

Projects follow `scheduled_tasks`, not sessions, **because §9 gives them no
project-level ACL** — they're owner-private, single-owner, never granted to
anyone else. With no `project_permissions` table to derive from, `user_id`
on the row is the correct and consistent choice. (The v1 label-based
`list_projects` derives ownership from `session_permissions` only because a label
has no row of its own to stamp — the first-class table removes that constraint.)
If §9 is ever reversed and projects become shareable, we would drop this column
and derive ownership from a `project_permissions` ACL, mirroring sessions.

**Migration (mirrors `z6…`):** `op.create_table("projects", …)` with the two
indexes; `op.add_column("omnigent_conversation_metadata", project_id)` + its
index. **No backfill needed** for empty-project support — existing sessions stay
`project_id = NULL` (unfiled). The `omni_project`-label → `project_id` backfill
is a **separate, later** step (only when migrating v1 label-projects), kept out
of this migration so Phase 1 stays clean and reversible.

## 6. Priority 2 — Move session in / create session in project

### 6.1 What
Move existing sessions into (or out of) a project, and start new sessions
already filed in a project.

### 6.2 UX — how a session joins a project

We deliberately **do not** add a project picker to the generic new-chat dialog.
That dialog is already dense (agent, host, workspace, git, model, effort,
permission mode); a picker would complicate the most-used "just start a chat"
flow. Sessions join projects from the project surface instead:

| Path | Behavior |
|---|---|
| **New session within a project** (primary) | From a project's header, "New session here" opens the new-chat dialog with the project pre-set and its defaults (host/workspace/harness — §8) pre-filled. This is where "create in project" happens. |
| **After creation** (session-row kebab) | "Add to / Change / Remove from project" submenu, `PATCH /v1/sessions/{id}` — for reorganizing existing sessions. |

- "Move session in/out" = update `project_id`. Moving to `null` = unfiled.
- Membership is the **owner's** private metadata (see §9): a session's project
  is scoped to its owner and does not travel to other viewers.

### 6.3 Sidebar & navigation
- Collapsible project sections, per-project counts (server-authoritative via
  `GET /v1/sessions/projects`, not the loaded page).
- Section precedence, highest wins: **Archived > Pinned > Project > Chats**
  (from v1 design §7). Confirm this survives the first-class-entity move.
- Filtering: `GET /v1/sessions?project=<id>`, incl. unfiled.
- Pagination correctness: counts from server `GROUP BY`; expand-time fetch of a
  project's full member list (v1 design §8).

## 7. Priority 3 — Rename projects

- First-class entity makes this a single `PATCH /v1/projects/{id}` on `name` —
  members are unaffected (they reference `project_id`, not the name string).
- Under v1 labels, rename means rewriting the label on every member (racy,
  O(members), breaks on unloaded pages) — another reason to go first-class.
- Validation: trim; reject empty/whitespace-only; max length (propose 100);
  **case-sensitive**, unique **per owner** (`workspace_id` + `owner` scope).
  Confirm case-sensitivity.

### 7.2 Optional — Reorder projects (client-only, not required)
- **Optional, not a launch requirement, and not a DB concern.** We deliberately
  do **not** add a `position` column. The server returns projects in a stable
  order (e.g. by `created_at` or name); manual ordering is a nice-to-have we can
  add later without a schema change.
- When we do add it, reorder should be a **client-only** preference (persisted in
  localStorage, like the existing collapsed-section state) rather than server
  state. Since projects are owner-private (§9), there's no shared-ordering
  concern to force it into the DB — an owner's arrangement is theirs alone, and a
  local preference is enough. Promoting it to a server column is a reversible
  future step if cross-device ordering is ever wanted.

## 8. Priority 4 — Project config: default working dir, host, memory & context

Break into the three sub-capabilities. All are **owner-private** (§9).

### 8.1 Default working directory & host
- **What:** a project stores a default `host_id` + `workspace` (and optionally
  default `git` base-branch / worktree policy, harness, model, reasoning
  effort). New sessions created "in" the project pre-fill these.
- **How it works with the host model:** `workspace` is a path *on a specific
  host*, and hosts are user-owned machines/sandboxes that go online/offline.
  Implications to design for:
  - The project's default host may be **offline** at session-create time →
    fall back to prompting for host, keep the workspace path as a hint.
  - For **managed** hosts, the "workspace" is a git repo URL that provisions a
    fresh sandbox per session — the project default is the repo URL + branch
    policy, not a live path.
  - Working directory remains **immutable per session** (existing constraint);
    the project only seeds the *initial* value.
  - **Proposed:** store project defaults as *hints*, never hard requirements —
    the new-chat dialog pre-fills them and always lets the user override, and
    silently drops any hint that isn't currently satisfiable (host offline).

### 8.2 Project-level memory (owner-private)
- **What:** a persistent memory store scoped to the project, readable/writable
  across all its sessions, so learnings accumulate across sessions instead of
  being lost per-session.
- **Grounding:** no cross-session memory exists today; `session_state` is
  per-conversation and policy-oriented. This is net-new.
- **Owner-private:** memory belongs to the project owner and is **never** exposed
  through a session shared individually with someone else (§9.4). This avoids
  the leak where one shared session would expose learnings aggregated from *all*
  the project's sessions — including ones never shared with that person.
- **Design questions to resolve:**
  - **Storage:** DB rows (project-scoped key/value or documents) vs. files in
    the project's default workspace (like agent memory files). DB is
    host-independent; files are natural for coding agents but tied to one
    workspace/host. **Proposed:** DB-backed project memory (host-agnostic,
    survives host churn), optionally surfaced to the agent as a virtual
    file/tool.
  - **How the agent reads/writes it:** injected into system context at session
    start? Exposed as a tool (read/append/update)? Both?
  - **Compaction interaction:** must survive conversation compaction — project
    memory lives outside the conversation so it's inherently durable.

### 8.3 Project-level context (owner-private)
- **What:** reference material attached to the project (pinned docs, links,
  instructions, files) that seeds every session's context.
- **Relationship to memory:** *context* = user-curated inputs (I give the
  project these docs/instructions); *memory* = agent-accumulated learnings (the
  agent records what it discovered). Keep them as distinct surfaces even if
  stored similarly. Both are owner-private.
- **Design questions:** size/token budget when injecting into new sessions;
  per-file include/exclude; whether context is copied into the session at start
  (snapshot) or referenced live (updates propagate). **Proposed:** referenced
  live with a snapshot-at-turn behavior, matching how instruction files work.

## 9. Decision: no project-level sharing (per-session ACL only)

**Decision: we do not add a project-level ACL.** Sharing stays per-session,
exactly as it is today. A project is the **owner's private organizer**; its
membership, memory, and context are the owner's private metadata and do not
travel to other viewers.

### 9.1 Why this is coherent
Two principles point the same way:
- Memory/context are **owner-private** (§8) — a project's learnings span multiple
  sessions, so exposing them through a single shared session would leak content
  from sessions never shared with that person.
- **Shared sessions ignore project** — when a session is shared, the *session*
  crosses the ACL boundary; its *project membership does not*.

The reconciling rule:

> A session's project membership is scoped to its **owner**. When a session is
> shared, the session crosses the ACL boundary; its project membership,
> memory, and context stay with the owner.

### 9.2 How it looks

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    subgraph Alice["Alice (owner)"]
        PX["Project X<br/>(private: defaults + memory + context)"]
        PX --> A["Session A"]
        PX --> B["Session B"]
        PX --> C["Session C"]
    end

    B -->|session ACL grant| BOB

    subgraph Bob["Bob's view"]
        SWM["Shared with me<br/>• Session B (ungrouped)"]
        BOB --> SWM
    end

    PX -.->|project + memory/context<br/>never cross| Bob
```

- Alice files sessions A/B/C under Project X — only **Alice** sees them grouped.
- Alice shares session B with Bob via the existing session ACL.
- Bob sees session B in **"Shared with me"**, **ungrouped** — no project, no
  memory, no context. Nothing leaks.

### 9.3 What this buys us
- No new `project_permissions` table, no inherited/computed grants, no
  move-in/move-out ACL recomputation.
- Requirements 1–4 (create, move, rename, defaults) — and the optional reorder —
  need no ACL at all.
- The existing per-`(user, conversation)` ACL does all sharing, unchanged.

### 9.4 Consequence to enforce
- Project memory/context access is gated by **ownership of the project**, never
  by a session-level grant. A session shared individually must not unlock the
  project's memory/context.

### 9.5 Owner-scoped membership (Model A)
Project membership is a single `project_id` owned by the session owner. A
recipient of a shared session **cannot** file it into one of *their own*
projects — shared sessions appear as a flat list in "Shared with me". Letting a
viewer organize *shared* sessions into their own projects (per-viewer membership,
"Model B") is a possible future extension and still needs **no** ACL, since each
user's memberships would be their own private metadata.

## 10. Priority 5 — What we do NOT support (intentional)

- **Project-level sharing / ACL** — sharing stays per-session (§9).
- **Nested projects / sub-projects.** One level only.
- **A session in multiple projects.** Membership is single, owner-scoped.
- **Per-viewer filing of shared sessions** ("Model B", §9.5) — deferred.
- **Automatic/AI-driven grouping** — grouping stays user-defined (per #863).
- **Org/team-owned projects** — no team entity exists; out of scope until one
  does.
- **Public (`__public__`) projects** — out of scope (follows from §9: projects
  aren't shared at all).

## 11. Phasing (proposed)

- **Phase 0 — Grouping (v1, shipped on main):** label-based projects
  (`omni_project`), sidebar sections, new-chat picker, kebab move. Per
  `SESSION_PROJECTS_SIDEBAR.md`.
- **Phase 1 — First-class entity:** `projects` table + CRUD, empty projects
  (P1), move/create-in-project (P2), rename (P3), delete semantics. Reorder is
  **optional** and, if added, client-only (§7.2). No label backfill here — the
  server dual-reads (§13), so first-class projects work alongside existing
  label-projects without migrating them. Shipped as three PRs: **1a** the project
  container (table + store + CRUD), **1b** session membership (the `project_id`
  column, conversation-store dual-read, and the session-move HTTP surfaces), and
  the **web UI** (sidebar create/rename/delete/move against the first-class
  entity, dual-reading label-projects) — see §12.
- **Phase 2 — Project defaults (P4a):** default host/workspace/harness/model
  seeded into the new-chat dialog when starting a session from within a project;
  graceful degradation when host offline / not owned.
- **Phase 3 — Memory & context (P4b/P4c):** owner-private project memory store +
  curated context; agent read/write; injection into sessions.
- **Phase 4 — Label consolidation (deferred, optional):** one-off backfill of
  `omni_project` label-projects into `projects` rows, then (only if ever)
  retiring the label path. Not required for the feature — dual-read makes it
  opportunistic cleanup, not a milestone (§12, §13).

## 12. Implementation status / TODO

Tracks what has actually landed vs. what remains. Updated as work ships.

### Done (Phase 1a — project container: entity + store + CRUD)
Shipped: the project **container** — create, list, rename, and delete empty
projects. Session→project membership landed separately in Phase 1b (below).
- ✅ **`projects` table** — `SqlProject` (`db_models.py`): `id` (Uuid16),
  `name`, `user_id`, `created_at`, `updated_at`. Owner-scoped index; a
  UNIQUE index on `(workspace_id, user_id, name)` enforced per-owner name
  uniqueness at the DB layer for non-NULL owners (the store's `_name_taken`
  check guarded NULL-owner / single-user rows, which SQL treats as distinct).
  That index was later dropped in `d5e6f7a8b9c0`, leaving `_name_taken` the
  sole guard for every owner.
  (No `config` column in Phase 1a — deferred so we didn't ship an unused
  column; added in Phase 2 via migration `b3c4d5e6f7a8`, see the TODO below.)
- ✅ **Migration** `b1c2d3e4f5a6` — creates the `projects` table only;
  additive, no backfill. Chained after `d4f2a1b6c8e9`.
- ✅ **Entity** — `Project` (`entities/project.py`).
- ✅ **Store** — `ProjectStore` + `SqlAlchemyProjectStore` (create/get/list/
  update/delete, owner-scoped; `IntegrityError` → `ALREADY_EXISTS` as the DB
  backstop for the uniqueness race — removed with the index in
  `d5e6f7a8b9c0`).
- ✅ **API** — `POST/GET/PATCH/DELETE /v1/projects` (`routes/projects.py`),
  request/response schemas, wired into `create_app` + CLI; `openapi.json`
  regenerated. Every handler is owner-scoped (projects are owner-private).
- ✅ Tests: store CRUD + owner isolation + name uniqueness (incl. DB backstop);
  route CRUD (single- + multi-user header auth); entity.

### Done (Phase 1b — session membership over HTTP)
Links sessions to projects and exposes it, completing Phase 1.
- ✅ **Membership column + migration** — nullable `project_id` (Uuid16) on
  `SqlConversationMetadata` (no DB FK, Rule R032; `NULL` = unfiled) via
  `c2d3e4f5a6b7`, an add-column migration chained after `b1c2d3e4f5a6`, plus
  `ix_conversation_metadata_project_id` and `Conversation.project_id`.
- ✅ **Conversation-store ops** — `set_conversation_project()` (file / move /
  unfile by id) and a **name-based dual-read** `list_conversations(project=…)`
  filter: a session is "in project `<name>`" if it has EITHER the first-class
  membership (`metadata.project_id` → the caller's project of that name) OR the
  legacy `omni_project` label with that value; `""` = unfiled. Cross-DB-safe;
  the prefetch is bounded to the caller's permission-scoped ids so the `IN` /
  `NOT IN` list can't grow past their own sessions. This is the §13 dual-read
  made real, so there is no coexisting pair of filters to reconcile later.
- ✅ **Session routes** — `PATCH /v1/sessions/{id}` files/unfiles by id
  (owner-only; target-project ownership validated → 404 otherwise) and
  `GET /v1/sessions?project=<name>` lists a project's sessions (owner-scoped);
  `project_id` surfaced on `SessionResponse` / `SessionListItem`; `openapi.json`
  regenerated.
- ✅ Tests: store membership ops + name-based dual-read (incl. unfiled and the
  cross-DB split-DB path); route move / unfile / list, single- and multi-user
  ownership boundaries.

### Done (Web UI — first-class projects in the sidebar)
Wires the web app to the first-class entity, keeping the label path working via
dual-read so no migration is forced. Folders are keyed by **name** (the union
key that merges a first-class project and a like-named label-project into one
folder), carrying the first-class `id` when one exists.
- ✅ **List dual-read** — `GET /v1/sessions/projects` now returns the UNION of
  first-class projects (`project_store.list`, incl. empty, with `id`) and legacy
  label-projects (`id=None`), merged by name and sorted. Response shape changed
  from `list[str]` to `list[{id, name}]`; owner-scoped as before.
- ✅ **First-class CRUD client** — `web/src/lib/projectsApi.ts`
  (`list/create/rename/delete` against `/v1/projects`); hooks `useCreateProject`,
  `useRenameProject`, and a reworked `useDeleteProject`. `useProjects` now
  returns `{id, name}[]`.
- ✅ **Create empty project** — a "New project" control (`NewProjectButton`) in
  the always-visible Projects section (My-sessions tab), even with zero
  projects (§5.3). `POST /v1/projects`.
- ✅ **Membership by `project_id`** — filing/moving a session (composer picker,
  row kebab, drag-drop) PATCHes `project_id`, resolving the picked name to an id
  and **creating the first-class row on demand** for a label-only folder. `""`
  unfiles. Sidebar groups a folder's members by first-class id OR the legacy
  label, and a row's "current project" dual-reads both (so pinned first-class
  members keep their project flyout).
- ✅ **Rename** — `PATCH /v1/projects/{id}` (O(1)); a label-only folder is
  promoted on demand (create + re-file members). **Delete** — archives and
  unfiles every member (clears `project_id` + `omni_project` label), then
  deletes the container; sessions are never deleted (§5.3, §7).
- ✅ Tests: `projectsApi` unit tests; reworked hook tests (resolve→file,
  create-on-demand, archive+unfile+delete); sidebar/composer suites updated;
  server union test. Empty folders read "No sessions".

### Done (Benchmark — #3094)
- ✅ **Latency journeys + corpus seeder.** Added `list_projects` (sidebar project
  list, dual-read union) and `list_project_sessions` (`?project=` folder fetch)
  latency journeys to `dev/benchmarks/omnigent`, mirroring the `list_sessions`
  hot read path. The corpus seeder now also seeds first-class `projects` rows
  and files a configurable fraction of sessions into them (`--projects`,
  `--filed-fraction`) so the journeys measure a realistic sidebar instead of an
  empty project set, and the PR benchmark regression check runs on
  `dev/benchmarks/**` changes. CRUD writes remain unbenchmarked (infrequent
  single-row ops).

### Done (Phase 2 — project defaults, P4a)
Complete, shipped across several PRs: default host/workspace/agent + an opt-in
worktree stored on the project and seeded into the new-chat composer.
  - ✅ **Backend `config` column.** Added a nullable `config` column to
    `projects` (migration `b3c4d5e6f7a8`, additive with a clean downgrade) and
    plumbed it through the store/entity/API. `config` is an **opaque JSON
    object**, not a typed schema: the backend persists it whole and never
    filters on it, so the key vocabulary (host/workspace/harness/model/
    reasoning-effort/git base-branch, …) is owned by the client and can grow
    without a schema change. Values are *hints* (§8.1). Store `update()`
    distinguishes `config=None` (leave unchanged) from `config={}` (clear), so
    a rename never wipes stored defaults. Exposed on `ProjectObject` /
    `CreateProjectRequest` / `UpdateProjectRequest` (openapi regenerated).
  - ✅ **Settings editor.** A "Project settings" dialog
    (`web/src/shell/ProjectSettingsDialog.tsx`, reached from the project-folder
    kebab menu) writes a project's `config`: host, working directory, default
    agent, and an opt-in "Random worktree" toggle. The `config` shape the client
    owns is `{ host_id?, workspace?, agent_id?, use_worktree? }`. Fields are
    optional (an unset one stores no key); an all-default dialog clears to `{}`.
    Worktrees are **opt-in** — the toggle defaults OFF and only an explicit ON is
    stored as `use_worktree: true` (matching "worktrees are opt-in at create
    time"). The host/agent pickers and filesystem browser reuse the composer's
    components.
  - ✅ **Seed defaults into the new-chat dialog.** The composer reads the stored
    `config` and pre-fills host / working directory / agent, always overridable,
    silently dropping any hint that isn't currently satisfiable (e.g. the default
    host is offline, or the configured agent is no longer registered). An unset
    field falls through to the composer's generic defaults (last host, recent
    workspace, last-used agent). The prefill machine waits while the projects
    list (name → id) or the config query is still loading, so a generic default
    can't win the race. An opt-in worktree (`use_worktree: true`) generates a
    fresh `worktree-<hex>` branch once the workspace is in place and confirmed a
    git repo — including for empty projects, where the workspace comes from the
    config or the home-fallback.
  - ✅ **Backend `config` hardening (from the #3108 review).** Both landed in
    `stores/project_store/sqlalchemy_store.py`: (a) `_encode_config` bounds the
    serialized `config` at 64 KiB (`_CONFIG_MAX_SERIALIZED_LEN`) and raises
    `INVALID_INPUT` past it — the value is persisted verbatim and reflected back,
    so an unbounded blob is a mild storage/response-size amplifier; (b)
    `_decode_config` coerces a non-dict blob (future writer / manual DB edit) back
    to `{}` rather than returning it raw, so callers can always treat config as a
    mapping.
  - ✅ **Replaced the inference-based prefill (PR #2133).** That merged PR
    prefilled the composer by *inferring* defaults from the project's newest
    session (host/agent/repo + a fresh worktree branch) — an explicit non-goal
    workaround for the absence of stored project defaults. Now that the dialog
    reads the stored `config`, the inference path is retired: `projectPrefill.ts`
    is collapsed to config-only seeding, and `useNewestProjectSession` (plus its
    `["project-newest-session"]` cache invalidations) is removed. Stored config
    is the single source of truth for a project's defaults; a project with no
    config prefills nothing project-specific (just the generic defaults).

### TODO
**Postponed.** Phases 1–2 (first-class projects + defaults) are shipped. Phases 3
and 4 below are **not scheduled**, each on a different trigger: Phase 3 waits for
customer evidence that project memory/context is wanted; Phase 4 waits until
telemetry shows most clients have migrated to a version that writes `project_id`
(so retiring the label path is safe). Both are additive and independent, so either
can start whenever its trigger lands.

- ⏸️ **Phase 3 — memory & context (P4b/P4c)** — new `project_memory` /
  `project_context` tables + agent read/write + injection (§8.2/§8.3). Postponed:
  the largest remaining chunk and the one with open design questions (§14 Q5/Q6);
  wait for customer evidence that cross-session project memory/context is wanted
  before committing to a storage + agent-surface design.
- ⏸️ **Phase 4 — label consolidation (postponed; not required for the feature).**
  Because the server dual-reads (a session is "in project X" if it has *either* a
  `project_id` *or* the `omni_project` label — see §13), the first-class feature
  works end-to-end without touching the label path, so this whole phase is
  deferred and may never be needed. Postponed until telemetry shows most clients
  have migrated to a version that writes `project_id` — retiring the label path is
  only safe once old label-writing clients are gone. Two steps, both optional:
  - **Label → `project_id` backfill** — a **separate one-off command/migration**
    converting existing `omni_project` label-projects (real production data) into
    `projects` rows. Gives a clean single source of truth, but dual-read means it
    is **not mandatory** — only needed if/when we decide to retire the label path.
  - **Retire the label path** — remove the `omni_project` reads/writes and the
    `?project=<name>` filter. This includes the one UI reader still on the label
    path: the Settings archived-only project picker
    (`fetchAllArchivedProjectNames`) derives its options from the `omni_project`
    label. Last step, if ever; do only after the backfill has run and telemetry
    shows no client still writes labels. Keeping the label path is cheap, so
    treat retirement as opportunistic cleanup, not a milestone.

## 13. Backwards compatibility (mixed server / client versions)

Because deployments can run an old client against a new server (or vice versa)
during a rollout, the design keeps every change additive:

- **DB / old server code, new schema.** Migration `b1c2d3e4f5a6` only *adds* a
  nullable column and a new table. An older server binary reading the migrated
  DB simply ignores `project_id` and the `projects` table — no column it selects
  disappears, no NOT NULL constraint is added. Rollback is a clean
  `downgrade()` (drops the column + table) since no existing data was rewritten.
- **New server, old client.** The `/v1/projects` routes and the `project_id`
  filter are *new* endpoints/params; an old web client that doesn't call them
  behaves exactly as before. `project_id` is an added field on the session
  snapshot — old clients ignore unknown JSON fields.
- **Old server, new client.** A new client may call `/v1/projects` or pass
  `?project_id=`; against a server without the router mounted these 404 / are
  ignored. The client must degrade gracefully (treat "no projects endpoint" as
  "feature off") — a UI requirement to note, not a data risk.
- **v1 label coexistence.** The label path (`omni_project`, `?project=<name>`)
  is untouched and runs alongside the new `project_id` path, so a client still
  on the label API keeps working through the transition. Neither path writes the
  other's storage, so a mixed fleet can't corrupt state — at worst a session is
  grouped by label on one client and unfiled by `project_id` on another until
  the backfill runs.
- **Server dual-reads to stay client-compatible.** Rather than forcing a client
  cutover, the server treats a session as "in project X" if it has *either* a
  `project_id` *or* the `omni_project` label. This keeps old web clients (which
  still write labels) working indefinitely with no forced upgrade, and means the
  label path can stay in place — retiring it is an optional, deferred cleanup
  (§12), not a milestone. The backfill (§12) migrates existing label data into
  rows for a clean single source of truth, but because of dual-read it is not a
  correctness prerequisite. Only if the label path is ever removed must clients
  first have shipped the `project_id` path.

## 14. Open questions

1. **§4** Confirm FK (`project_id`) over label-of-id for membership.
   (Proposed: FK.)
2. **§6.2 / §8.1** When starting a session from within a project, auto-fill
   host/workspace/harness from project defaults (overridable)? (Proposed: yes.)
3. **§7.1** Case-sensitive, per-owner-unique project names? Max length 100?
4. **§8.1** Store project defaults as soft hints (drop when unsatisfiable) vs.
   hard requirements? (Proposed: soft hints.)
5. **§8.2** Project memory storage: DB vs. workspace files? (Proposed: DB.)
6. **§8.2/8.3** How is memory/context surfaced to the agent — system-context
   injection, a tool, or both?
7. **§9.5** Do we ever want per-viewer filing of shared sessions (Model B), or
   is a flat "Shared with me" list sufficient long-term?

# Machine Auth — Client Credentials Grant (RFC 6749 §4.4)

> **IMPLEMENTED.**
>
> A single confidential client exchanges its own credentials for a delegated,
> path-scoped access token acting as a fixed machine principal. No browser, no
> per-user consent, no polling — the client *is* the resource owner.
>
> Server: `omnigent/server/routes/client_credentials.py` (the grant handler,
> the `MachineClientConfig` env registry, and the principal guards). It owns
> no route: `create_oauth_token_router` in
> `omnigent/server/routes/device_auth.py` owns the app's one
> `POST /oauth/token` and dispatches to this grant by `grant_type`. It reuses
> `mint_delegated_token` / `DELEGATED_SCOPE` from that same module, the scope
> enforcement in `omnigent/server/auth.py` (`delegated_path_allowed`), and the
> response helpers + sliding-window throttle both grants share in
> `omnigent/server/routes/_oauth.py`. Wired in `omnigent/server/app.py`,
> **opt-in and default-off**: the handler is built only when a machine client
> is configured and its principal is vetted, and only in the cookie-based auth
> modes (`oidc` and `accounts`). Unconfigured, `client_credentials` exchanges
> answer `unsupported_grant_type`.
>
> Tests: `tests/server/test_client_credentials.py`,
> `tests/server/integration/test_client_credentials_e2e.py`, and
> `tests/server/test_oauth_shared.py` for the helpers both grants share.

## Problem

The device grant (`designs/DEVICE_AUTH.md`) answers "a browserless client must
act **as a human**, without ever holding that human's credentials". It does not
answer the other case: a headless process that acts **as itself** — a scheduled
job, a webhook receiver, an internal service calling the sessions API. There is
no human to consent, so a flow built around out-of-band browser consent has
nothing to ask.

Before this grant, such a process had two bad options: drive the interactive
login of a service account (a browser in a job), or be handed the server's
cookie-signing key and mint its own session tokens (unbounded privilege, no
audit trail, no way to distinguish it from a human session).

## Role mapping

| RFC 6749 role        | Here                                            |
|----------------------|-------------------------------------------------|
| Authorization Server | Omnigent server (`POST /oauth/token`)           |
| Resource Server      | Omnigent server (existing `/v1/**` APIs)        |
| Client               | The headless process, holding the client secret |
| Resource Owner       | The client itself — no third party              |

## Configuration

One confidential client, read from the environment at mount. No table, no
migration: a second client would need a real registry, and the single-client
case covers "this deployment has an automation identity".

| Variable | Meaning |
|----------|---------|
| `OMNIGENT_MACHINE_CLIENT_ID` | The client identifier presented at the token endpoint. An operator-chosen label: nothing allocates it, and it has no charset or length validation. That is fine per RFC 6749 §2.2 — `client_id` is public and not a secret — but it means **all the security rests on the secret below**, not on the id being hard to guess. |
| `OMNIGENT_MACHINE_CLIENT_SECRET_HASH` | The client secret in **stored form only** — its `hash_secret` digest (HMAC-SHA256 keyed by `cookie_secret`, so 64 hex characters). The raw secret never reaches the server's config, and a value that is not that digest's shape is refused at startup rather than 401ing forever. Generate the secret with `secrets.token_urlsafe(32)` or equivalent: because only the digest is configured, the server cannot measure the secret's entropy, so that part is operator discipline — see row 3 of the threat table for the half that *is* enforced. |
| `OMNIGENT_MACHINE_SUB` | The machine principal the minted token acts as (the `sub` claim). Must be a distinct, non-admin identity. |
| `OMNIGENT_MACHINE_TOKEN_TTL` | Access-token lifetime in seconds (default 3600, and **capped** at 3600). |

All three of the first group must be set to enable the grant, or all unset to
leave it off. **All unset is the default and builds no handler**, so a
`client_credentials` exchange answers `unsupported_grant_type` — the config is
the opt-in, and no other flag turns this grant on. (The device grant needs a
separate `OMNIGENT_DEVICE_GRANT_ENABLED` because its endpoints are useful with
zero config; this grant has nothing to serve without a configured client.)

Anything else — two of three, a malformed secret hash, a reserved principal,
an unparseable / non-positive / over-ceiling TTL — raises at startup **in
`oidc` / `accounts` mode**. A half-configured deploy that came up anyway would
look like a client bug from the outside; failing to start puts the error where
the operator can act on it.

The qualifier is load-bearing. `app.py` only reaches this config when the auth
mode is `oidc` or `accounts`, so in **header mode** a machine client is never
parsed and never validated: a fully misconfigured one is silently inert. That
is the one place this grant does fail quiet. It is the same shape as the device
grant, whose flag is likewise ignored in header mode (neither mode can mint,
since header auth has no server-held signing key), but an operator who sets
`OMNIGENT_MACHINE_*` under header auth gets no signal at all.

The TTL ceiling is enforced, not advised: expiry is this grant's only
revocation (below), so the TTL is the whole bound on a stolen token. 3600s
also matches the device grant's fixed access-token lifetime.

The one-hour cap with no refresh token is a deliberate boundary, not an
oversight: this grant is for a process that starts, mints, does its work inside
the hour, and exits. A daemon that must stay authenticated for days is the
login grant's case (`designs/DEVICE_AUTH.md`, `issue_login_grant`), which has
the refresh machinery and the store-backed revocation to match.

### Provisioning a secret

Generate the secret, then configure only its digest. `hash_secret` is
HMAC-SHA256 keyed by the hex-decoded `cookie_secret`, so the digest depends on
the server's `OMNIGENT_ACCOUNTS_COOKIE_SECRET` (or the OIDC equivalent):

```python
import hashlib, hmac, os, secrets

SECRET = secrets.token_urlsafe(32)  # give this to the client
cookie_secret = bytes.fromhex(os.environ["OMNIGENT_ACCOUNTS_COOKIE_SECRET"])
print(hmac.new(cookie_secret, SECRET.encode(), hashlib.sha256).hexdigest())
```

Print the digest into `OMNIGENT_MACHINE_CLIENT_SECRET_HASH` and keep `SECRET`
only where the client can read it.

**Rotation is a hard cutover.** One hash is configurable, so there is no
two-secret grace window: the moment the server takes a new digest, the old
secret stops working. Change both sides together, or accept failed mints in
between — the client re-mints on a bounded TTL, so the window is the client's
retry, not a permanent outage.

`cookie_secret` is the shared root of trust: it keys both the stored
secret-hash comparison and the signature on issued tokens. Rotating it
therefore invalidates the configured hash **and** every live machine token —
the startup log says so where an operator will see it.

## Flow

```
  client                                       server
    |  POST /oauth/token                         |
    |  grant_type=client_credentials             |
    |  + Basic base64(id:secret)  ─────────────► |  dispatch on grant_type
    |                                            |  throttle, then constant-time id + digest check
    |                                            |  re-vet the sub, then mint_delegated_token
    |                                            |  (scope set, no grant_id)
    |  ◄── {access_token, Bearer, expires_in,    |
    |       scope}                               |
    |                                            |
    |  Authorization: Bearer <jwt>  ───────────► |  path allowlist, no cache, no denylist lookup
```

Client authentication accepts either RFC 6749 §2.3.1 form: HTTP Basic (which
takes precedence) or `client_id` / `client_secret` form fields. Both halves of
the comparison always run and are combined without short-circuiting, so a
failure leaks nothing through timing about which half was wrong. Per §2.3.1 the
two halves of a Basic credential are form-urlencoded before the base64, so they
are urldecoded after the split on `:` (a secret containing `:`, `%`, `+` or a
space would otherwise be read wrong); the scheme token itself is matched
case-insensitively per RFC 7235 §2.1. One consequence of that urldecode: `a+b`
and `a b` presented over Basic collapse to the same secret, so a self-chosen
passphrase containing `+`, `%` or a space has slightly less effective entropy
than its length suggests. The recommended `secrets.token_urlsafe(32)` output is
base64url and contains none of those characters, so it is unaffected.

The endpoint is throttled per source IP — the same in-memory sliding-window
limiter the device grant applies to its public authorize endpoint, now shared in
`omnigent/server/routes/_oauth.py`. It gates the endpoint ahead of the
credential comparison, not just failed authentications: a limiter that only
counted failures would still answer the guess that happened to be right, so the
guess *rate* is the thing bounded. Ten requests per minute per IP is far above
honest use, since a machine client mints once per token TTL.

A successful response carries `scope` alongside the token. RFC 6749 §5.1 makes
it REQUIRED when the granted scope differs from one the client requested, and
this grant always issues `DELEGATED_SCOPE` regardless of what §4.4.2 lets the
client ask for — so it always differs, and is always stated.

Error shapes are the RFC's: any other `grant_type` is `unsupported_grant_type`;
an absent, malformed, or mismatched client is `401 invalid_client`; a client
that authenticates but whose principal no longer passes the admin check is
`400 unauthorized_client` (§5.2 puts the error codes at 400 unless it says
otherwise); a source over the throttle is `429 slow_down` (the shape RFC 8628
§3.5 registers, and what the device grant's throttle already answers with).
There is no "configured but inactive" answer — an unconfigured or refused grant
simply has no handler, so `client_credentials` is `unsupported_grant_type` like
any other grant type the server does not serve.

### One token endpoint

`POST /oauth/token` is mounted in every accounts/oidc deploy with a permission
store, because login-issued refresh grants need it whether or not the device
flow is on. This grant is therefore a `grant_type` branch of that one endpoint,
never a router of its own. A second router on the same path is not an error
FastAPI reports: it registers both and resolves first-match-wins, so the loser
goes silent while its startup log still claims it is enabled. The branch also
keeps the throttle scoped to this grant — hoisting it to the whole endpoint
would newly rate-limit login-grant refreshes, which is costly behind a shared
NAT egress address where many hosts renew through one source IP.

Every response from the endpoint carries `Cache-Control: no-store` and
`Pragma: no-cache` (RFC 6749 §5.1, and §5.2 for the error shape). A `401
invalid_client` that rejected an `Authorization` header also carries the
`WWW-Authenticate: Basic` challenge §5.2 requires; form credentials get no
challenge, since there is no header attempt to retry.

## Token shape

The minted token is the delegated JWT the device grant already defines, with
one difference: the `scope` claim is set and `grant_id` is **absent**.

- `scope` puts the token under the fail-closed path allowlist
  (`delegated_path_allowed`), so it can never reach admin or user-management
  endpoints, and keeps it out of the token-keyed credential cache — a cached
  entry replayed on a non-allowlisted path would skip the allowlist.
- No `grant_id` means no store-backed grant and so no per-token revocation
  lookup. Revocation here is by expiry and secret rotation; a deployment that
  needs immediate, per-token kill should use the store-backed device grant.
- `act` carries `{"client_id": ...}` so every action stays attributable to the
  configured client.

The two claims are independent, and `_check_cookie` reads each for its own
question. Confinement keys off **`scope` being present**, revocation off
**`grant_id` being present**, which gives the server three token shapes:

| Token | `scope` | `grant_id` | Path allowlist | Revocation denylist |
|-------|---------|------------|----------------|---------------------|
| Device grant (third-party client acting for a human) | set | set | confined | checked |
| Login grant (first-party `omnigent-cli`) | absent | set | full authority | checked |
| Machine client (this grant) | set | absent | confined | skipped |

The middle row is deliberate: a login grant renews the session JWT it replaced
and keeps that same authority. Getting the key wrong inverts two rows at once —
confining on `grant_id`'s *absence* would hand a machine token full authority
while confining the login grant that is supposed to have it, and running the
revocation lookup unguarded would reject every machine token, since the lookup
fails closed on an unknown grant. `test_token_authority_table` and
`test_revocation_denylist_applies_only_to_stored_grants` pin all three rows
together so the pair cannot drift apart again.

## Security analysis

| # | Threat | Mitigation |
|---|--------|-----------|
| 1 | Leaked client secret → token minting | The secret is a fixed operator config held only by the client, never user-supplied and never in a browser. Rotation is a config change on both sides; the stored form is a keyed digest, so a config leak alone does not yield a usable secret. |
| 2 | Server-side config leak → secret recovery | Only the `hash_secret` digest is configured; the raw secret is never stored or logged. |
| 3 | Credential probing / timing oracle | Client id and secret digest are compared with `hmac.compare_digest` and combined non-short-circuiting; every failure is the same `401 invalid_client`. The endpoint is also unauthenticated by definition, so it is rate-limited per source IP ahead of the comparison (`429 slow_down`), bounding the guess rate — **but only below the limiter's key-table ceiling** (`RATE_LIMITER_MAX_KEYS`). Past that the limiter fails open by design (availability over a soft throttle), so an attacker who first exhausts the table from disposable source addresses (trivial over an IPv6 /64) then guesses unthrottled from a fresh one. The throttle is a speed bump, not the boundary. The secret's own entropy is not machine-checkable — only its digest is configured — so that half is stated as operator guidance in the configuration table above rather than pretended to be enforced. |
| 4 | Token used beyond its purpose | Fail-closed path allowlist on every request (no cache shortcut), plus an enforced TTL ceiling and no refresh token. |
| 5 | **Privilege escalation through an admin principal** | The allowlist confines *paths*, not privilege: `/v1/sessions` grants `LEVEL_OWNER` to any `is_admin` identity, so an admin `sub` would own every tenant's session. The permission store is asked whether the configured `sub` is an admin at mount (the handler is not built if so) **and again before every mint** (`400 unauthorized_client`), so promoting the principal later stops new tokens without a restart. Both checks fail closed if the store cannot answer, and the refusal names which of the two it hit, so a store outage is not misread as a bad `sub`. Tokens already issued to a since-promoted `sub` live out their TTL — bounded by row 7's ceiling. |
| 6 | Identity confusion with a human account | Operator discipline, with the machine-checkable part enforced and the rest warned about. A reserved sentinel (`local`, `__public__`) is refused outright. At mount the server also scans the user roster and **logs a warning if `OMNIGENT_MACHINE_SUB` matches an existing account**, since pointing it at a real person's address silently mints tokens acting as that person. The scan is advisory, not a gate: `list_users` is bounded (1000 rows), so a larger deploy may not spot the match, and a store fault leaves the warning unsaid — neither changes whether the grant runs. The standing guidance is unchanged: **give the machine client a fresh, dedicated identity** so audit stays legible and it inherits no human's grants. |
| 7 | Stolen token cannot be revoked | Accepted, and bounded: the TTL is capped at 3600s (`OMNIGENT_MACHINE_TOKEN_TTL` above that refuses to start), and secret rotation stops re-minting. Per-token revocation is the store-backed device grant's model, not this one. |
| 8 | Cookie-secret rotation silently breaking auth | One key underpins both the secret check and token signing; the startup log states the coupling so rotation is not debugged twice. |
| 9 | Token cached by a proxy or client | Every token-endpoint response sends `Cache-Control: no-store` + `Pragma: no-cache` (RFC 6749 §5.1), as does the device grant's `POST /oauth/device/authorize` 200, whose `device_code` + `user_code` are as sensitive (RFC 8628 §3.2). The shared header mapping is read-only, so a caller cannot mutate the constant every grant router hands to its responses. |

### Deliberate limits

- **No path-prefixing reverse proxy.** `delegated_path_allowed` matches
  `request.url.path`, which includes any ASGI `root_path`. Mount the server
  under a prefix (`root_path="/api"`) and every confined token is refused on
  every route, including the ones it should reach — the allowlist compares
  `/api/v1/sessions` against a table of unprefixed prefixes. It fails closed,
  so this is a broken grant rather than a bypass, but it is silent. The
  existing device grant shares the assumption, since it reads the same
  allowlist. Making the match `root_path`-aware is a follow-up if a
  prefixed deployment ever needs to be supported.
- **One client.** A second confidential client needs a persisted registry with
  its own lifecycle; the env-configured single entry covers the automation
  identity case without one.
- **Shared scope with the device grant.** `scope="sessions"` reuses the
  existing delegated allowlist, which also covers `/v1/agents`, `/v1/hosts` and
  `/v1/runners`. Narrowing it per grant would change the
  `delegated_path_allowed` contract both grants read, so a machine token
  inherits whatever those prefixes hold — the same surface the device grant
  already exposes. Confining it further is the per-grant-scopes follow-up
  below; this grant adds no new reachable path.
- **No refresh token.** The client re-mints; there is nothing to rotate or
  replay-detect.
- **In-process throttle.** The limiter is per replica and keyed by source IP,
  the same shape and the same limits the device grant already runs on. A
  multi-replica deployment multiplies the ceiling by the replica count, and a
  distributed guesser spreads across source IPs; a shared-store limiter is the
  fix if that ever matters. It is a rate bound, not the security boundary —
  that is the secret's entropy, which the server cannot check because only the
  digest is configured.

## Out of scope / follow-ups

- A persisted multi-client registry with per-client scopes and an admin UI.
- Per-grant scopes, so a machine token can be confined more tightly than the
  shared session-API allowlist.
- Asymmetric client authentication (`private_key_jwt`, RFC 7523) for
  deployments that would rather not distribute a shared secret at all.
- **The throttle counts successful mints too**, so a legitimate client's budget
  is burnable by anyone sharing its source address — a neighbour behind the
  same NAT egress, or an unauthenticated cross-site POST that only has to reach
  the endpoint to cost a hit. Refunding the hit on a successful mint is the
  one-line fix; the client re-mints on a bounded TTL, so today's blast radius
  is a delayed mint rather than a lost session.
- **A confined request that is denied is not attributable.** The allowlist
  refusal happens in `_check_cookie`, which returns `None` without recording
  which client, `sub` or path was refused — so a machine client probing off its
  allowlist leaves no audit trail to alert on. Logging the refusal (at a
  bounded rate, since the path is attacker-reachable) is the follow-up.
- `root_path`-aware allowlist matching, so the grant survives a
  path-prefixing reverse proxy (see *Deliberate limits* above).

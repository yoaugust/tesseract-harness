"""Unit tests for the REPL's session-metadata refresh.

``_refresh_session_metadata`` re-fetches the session snapshot so an
in-place agent switch made from another client (web UI "Switch
agent") is reflected in the attached REPL: the adapter's agent name,
the toolbar label / window title, and the hydrated metadata
(``llm_model`` / ``harness`` / ``context_window``) all update. It has
two triggers: the ``session.agent_changed`` stream event (live, while
attached) and each turn start (catch-up — the event is transient
SSE-only, so one missed during a stream-pump reconnect gap or before
the REPL attached is never replayed).

Drives the real ``_SessionsChatReplAdapter`` and real SDK ``Session``
snapshots against stub client/host objects, so the full hydrate path
is exercised — not a re-implementation of it.

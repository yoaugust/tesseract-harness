"""Unit tests for the sessions-API REPL adapter event translator.

Three CUJs caught these regressions during manual testing of
``omnigent run`` in sessions mode:

1. ``ResponseCreated`` was imported from the public ``omnigent_client``
   re-export, which doesn't include it. ImportError on first turn.
2. The adapter passed server-shape events
   (:class:`omnigent.server.schemas.OutputTextDeltaEvent`) through
   without translating to the SDK-shape dataclasses in
   :mod:`omnigent_client._events`. Net: spinner spun, server-side
   LLM call completed, no assistant text reached the TUI.
3. The translator initially used wrong class names from
   ``omnigent.server.schemas`` (``ResponseTextDeltaEvent`` vs the
   actual ``OutputTextDeltaEvent``); silent ImportError on the local
   import inside the translator.

This file pins each translation case so all three classes of bug
surface at import time or in a sub-second unit test.

"""
Tests for :mod:`omnigent.repl._resume_picker` — the
stderr/stdin interactive picker that ports legacy ``--resume`` to
AP mode.

Three layers:

1. **Pure picker** (:func:`pick_conversation`) driven with
   ``StringIO`` and real pseudo-terminals — covers selection,
   navigation, cancellation, and invalid input. No SDK / store
   involvement.
2. **Store-backed convenience**
   (:func:`pick_conversation_from_store`) against a real
   :class:`SqlAlchemyConversationStore` /
   :class:`SqlAlchemyAgentStore` — covers the agent-id scoping
   and the empty-list / unknown-agent paths the one-shot CLI
   relies on.
3. The SDK-backed convenience (:func:`pick_conversation_from_sdk`)
   is exercised by the chat REPL's e2e flow rather than mocked
   here — same reason the SDK-side ``write_session_log`` isn't
   double-tested in ``test_session_log.py``.

"""
Tests for :mod:`omnigent.inner._seccomp`.

The module owns two responsibilities and these tests cover both:

1. The libseccomp ctypes plumbing — that
   :func:`apply_seccomp_filter` actually loads a BPF program into the
   kernel and that argument-filtered rules (``SCMP_CMP_EQ``,
   ``SCMP_CMP_MASKED_EQ``) behave as expected against real syscalls.

2. The shared syscall denylist
   :data:`BASELINE_DENYLIST_SYSCALLS` — that the list stays aligned
   with the upstream Kubernetes / containerd ``RuntimeDefault``
   profile we derive it from, and that
   :func:`apply_baseline_denylist` actually engages the kernel.

Each test that installs a real seccomp filter does so inside a
forked child process so the BPF filter doesn't leak into pytest's
process and break the rest of the suite.

# S6 — request-line smuggling on the CONNECT (MITM) path
#
# The CONNECT handler enforces its path/method allow-list against a
# parse of the inner (MITM-decrypted) request line, but historically
# forwarded the *raw* request-line bytes to the upstream verbatim. The
# policy parse uses ``str.split()`` (no argument), which treats bare
# ``\r``/``\t``/``\v``/``\f`` as whitespace. A sandboxed agent that
# controls the inner HTTP bytes could embed a bare ``\r`` so the proxy
# saw one (method, path) while a lenient upstream parsed a different,
# smuggled request line — collapsing a fine-grained egress rule
# (e.g. ``GET host/repos/myorg/**``) to "any method, any path" on an
# already-allow-listed host. The fix rejects control bytes in the inner
# request line AND re-serializes the forwarded request line from the
# parsed (method, path) so the policy decision and the forwarded bytes
# can never diverge.

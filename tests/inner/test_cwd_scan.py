"""
Shared cwd-walker decision tests for the sandbox backends.

The walker in :mod:`omnigent.inner._cwd_scan` is consumed by every
spawn-time sandbox backend (``linux_bwrap``, ``darwin_seatbelt``)
to decide which cwd entries must be masked from the helper. Backend
emit code (``--bind /dev/null`` / ``--tmpfs`` for bwrap, ``(deny
file-* (literal/subpath ...))`` for Seatbelt) lives in each backend
module and is asserted there. This module verifies the
**decision** layer once so a regression that would expose ``.env`` to
the agent fails the same test for both backends on whichever host
runs the suite.

Tests assert on :class:`MaskedEntry` tuples directly, not on backend-
specific tokens. They run on every platform — the walker is pure
Python and doesn't shell out to ``bwrap`` / ``sandbox-exec``.

"""File-tool reach grants (#2070).

The runner-local file tools (``sys_os_read`` / ``sys_os_write`` /
``sys_os_edit``) are confined to the session workspace by
``_assert_within_reach``. These tests pin the security contract of the grant
extension:

- **Default unchanged:** with NO path grants declared, nothing outside cwd is
  reachable -- byte-for-byte the historical cwd-only confinement.
- A **read** grant admits reads only; it never confers write.
- A **write** grant (directory or single file) admits writes AND reads of that
  subtree (a writable path is readable), so ``edit`` works there.
- Symlink / ``..`` traversal cannot escape a grant into ungranted paths (the
  target is resolved before it is compared to the grant roots).
- Grants may be declared relative to cwd, and may target a single file.
- ``resolve_sandbox`` under ``sandbox.type: none`` carries these grants onto
  the (still-inactive) policy, and still rejects a network restriction.

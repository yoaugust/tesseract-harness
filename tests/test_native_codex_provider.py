"""Tests for native-Codex provider routing (configure harnesses parity).

Covers :func:`omnigent.inner.codex_executor._provider_codex_config_overrides`

the path that makes a native Codex terminal route through a ``configure

the Databricks ucode profile. Providers are constructed via the real config
parser; config + ambient are isolated so resolution is deterministic.

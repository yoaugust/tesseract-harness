"""Tests for the CLI-side daemon-launch polling helpers.

Covers ``omnigent.host.daemon_launch``: the online-wait loops must poll
through *transient* transport errors (connection refused while the local
server is still binding, a dropped keepalive) instead of crashing on the
first one, and must surface the last transport error when the deadline
expires. A regression here reproduces the CI failure where a single
refused status poll killed ``omnigent run`` with a bare
``httpx.ConnectError`` even though the deadline had 50+ seconds left.

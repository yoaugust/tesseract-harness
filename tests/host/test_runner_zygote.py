"""Tests for the runner zygote forkserver and its host-side client.

These drive a REAL zygote subprocess (``os.fork`` works on macOS and Linux even
though the copy-on-write memory savings are Linux-only), using the zygote's
test seam so forked children exit deterministically instead of booting a real
runner. Fork-safety, the ping/fork/poll/reap protocol, env isolation, and the
daemon's Popen fallback are all covered.

"""Tests for the per-user daily cost-budget policy.

``user_daily_cost_budget`` gates the ``request`` and ``tool_call`` phases
on the session OWNER's cumulative spend for the current UTC day, read from
``event["context"]["user_daily_cost"]`` (injected by the engine). Same
ASK/DENY/downgrade logic as ``cost_budget``, but:

- the budget is the owner's daily spend, not the session's;
- an approved soft checkpoint is read from / recorded to the daily
  store (``ask_approved_usd``) rather than ``session_state``, via the
  reserved ``USER_DAILY_ASK_APPROVED_STATE_KEY`` state-update the engine
  routes to that store.

These exercise the policy callable directly with synthetic events — the
engine wiring (injection + state-update routing) is covered by the
engine and store tests.

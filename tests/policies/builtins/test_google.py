"""
Tests for the built-in Google Workspace policies
(:mod:`omnigent.policies.builtins.google`) — the three sibling factories
``gdrive_policy`` / ``gmail_policy`` / ``gcalendar_policy`` in one module.

Layers per policy:

- **Layer 1** — direct callable: verb / allowlist gating, created-ID tracking,
  MCP-prefix-agnostic matching, fail-closed on unknown same-service tools, and
  abstention on other services (the composition guarantee).
- **Layer 2** — spec resolution through :func:`resolve_function_policy`.
- **Layer 3** — created-ID roundtrip via a real :class:`PolicyEngine` + SQLite
  store (proves ``session_state`` persistence across an engine rebuild).
- **Layer 4** — registry discovery: all three are one ``POLICY_REGISTRY`` with
  three factory entries, validated against their schemas.

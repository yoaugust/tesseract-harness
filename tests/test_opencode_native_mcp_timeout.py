"""Regression tests: opencode-native MCP entries must not inherit the 60 s default.

The bug: opencode's MCP client defaults to a 60 s SDK timeout for every tool call.
Omnigent's relay budget is 300 s (_TOOL_CALL_TIMEOUT_S).  Any relayed tool call
longer than 60 s (long shell, large search, blocking sub-agent, approval wait) is
killed by opencode with "MCP error -32001: Request timed out" even though the
relay is willing to wait.

Root causes (three independent gaps):
  1. ``build_opencode_omnigent_mcp_server`` never writes a ``timeout`` key into
     the generated MCP entry, so opencode uses the SDK default of 60 s.
  2. ``build_opencode_mcp_block`` never propagates ``MCPServerConfig.timeout``
     into the generated entry, so a spec author also cannot configure around it.
  3. The bridge never emits ``notifications/progress``, which is the one mechanism
     that would let opencode's ``resetTimeoutOnProgress`` extend the deadline
     without a static number.

These tests assert each gap so the fix has a concrete fail→pass target.

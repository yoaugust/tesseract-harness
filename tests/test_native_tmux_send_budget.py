"""The per-command tmux send budget must be uniform across native bridges.

Every native harness bridge shells out to ``tmux`` for keystroke delivery
with a flat per-command subprocess timeout. A bridge whose budget is shorter
than its siblings' dies first under the same machine load: parallel worker
boots on a large worktree can starve a healthy tmux server past 5s, and the
first dispatch send then fails the worker on infra (or is silently lost,
stranding the supervisor). The identical operation must get the identical
budget everywhere, and that budget must cover a realistic boot-load stall.

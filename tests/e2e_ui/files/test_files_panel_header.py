"""E2E: the Files rail "Working folder" header — never a collapse toggle, and
a browse control when the session has somewhere else to go.

The desktop Workspace rail renders ``FilesPanel`` in its ``frameless``
(inline) mode. Three behaviours are pinned here:

1. The header never collapses the panel. The file list is the whole point of
   the panel, so there is nothing to collapse to. This guards against
   reintroducing the collapse chevron: the header once doubled as a collapse
   toggle carrying ``aria-expanded``, which made no sense here. A session with
   nowhere else to browse (no bound host) keeps the plain, unclickable label.
2. The header's eye shows hidden files by default and reads as state: plain
   while dot-prefixed entries are listed, slashed once they are filtered out.
3. When the session IS host-bound and unconfined, the working-folder path
   becomes a button that opens the workspace directory browser, and picking a
   directory re-roots the file tree there — through the real server, runner,
   and filesystem, not a stub.
4. Opening that browser does not flash a tooltip over the listing: the
   popover focuses its first icon button, and only a hover may label it.

None of them send a message — the header is rail state, not a function of any
turn — so they all stay fast, LLM-free checks.

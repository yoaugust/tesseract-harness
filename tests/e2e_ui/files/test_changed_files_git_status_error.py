"""E2E: a git-status failure surfaces in the Files panel, not a blank list.

Regression guard for the "blank panel == clean tree" ambiguity. The changed-files
view (``/changes`` -> ``GitFilesystemRegistry.list_changed_files``) used to swallow
every ``git status`` failure to an empty list, which ``FlatFileList`` renders
identically to a genuinely clean tree ("No workspace changes yet"). A read that
*could not run* was therefore indistinguishable from "nothing changed", which is
exactly what made a real worktree report impossible to diagnose.

The fix makes ``/changes`` return ``500 {error:{code:"git_status_failed", message}}``
on failure, and the web hook (``useWorkspaceChangedFiles``) parses that body and
throws so the panel shows "Failed to load: <reason>" (in the destructive style)
instead of the misleading empty state.

The failure is injected by intercepting the ``/changes`` request and fulfilling it
with the 500 error shape the runner now returns — no real git breakage needed — so
the test deterministically exercises the hook's error parsing and the panel's error
branch. Everything else (environment availability, liveness) stays real so the
changed-files query actually fires.

"""E2E: with the runner offline but the host alive, the Files panel stays live.

When a session's runner process dies but the host that holds the workspace on
disk is still connected, the server reads the file panel (browse / changed
files / file content / diff) over the host tunnel instead of returning 503.
The web app must then keep the panel working — showing files and a passive
"Asleep — files shown live from the host" badge — rather than falling back to
the "agent is asleep, send a message to reconnect" dead-end.

The frontend cannot tell which side served the bytes; it decides purely from
the ``/health`` liveness (``runner_online`` / ``host_online``) plus whether the
filesystem queries succeed. So this drives the real SPA against a real
server-backed session (whose live runner actually serves the seeded files),
but patches the browser's *view* of liveness into the runner-offline /
host-online shape — exactly the state the host-served path produces in
production. Mirrors ``sessions/test_host_badge.py``'s liveness patching.

No LLM is involved: the file is seeded via the filesystem PUT endpoint.

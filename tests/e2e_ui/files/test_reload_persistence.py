"""E2E: file-viewer and comment state survive a full browser reload.

These tests prove the durability path that the AppShell unit tests can
only approximate: ``AppShell.test.tsx`` mocks ``FileViewer`` and asserts
the ``?file=`` / ``?comment=`` params are wired into component state, but
it never re-fetches from a real server or re-hydrates a real viewer. Here
we seed state through the REST API, drive the real SPA, then call
``page.reload()`` and assert the same state re-renders from scratch —
which can only pass if (a) the server persisted it and (b) the SPA
rebuilds its view from the URL on a cold load.

No LLM is involved: files are seeded via the filesystem PUT endpoint and
comments via ``POST /v1/sessions/{id}/comments``, so the tests are
deterministic.

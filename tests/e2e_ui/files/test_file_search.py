"""E2E: the Files-panel search box filters the All-files tree.

In the All (folder-tree) scope the search field runs a server-side recursive
``/search`` call and renders the matches as a flat list (``useWorkspaceFileSearch``
→ ``FolderTree`` search mode). Three files with distinguishing name fragments are
seeded so a query can isolate a subset and exclude the rest.

Note on scope: the *Changed* scope's search filters the changed-files list, which
in this e2e harness can only be populated by a git workspace or the agent's
``sys_os_write`` tool — neither is reachable deterministically here (the seeded
temp workspace is non-git, and the openai-agents harness writes outside the
web-visible ``default`` environment). The Changed-list filter is covered by the
``FlatFileList`` component test instead. This e2e pins the server-backed All search.

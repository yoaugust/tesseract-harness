"""E2E: the optimistic user-message bubble lifecycle in the chat surface.

These browser tests drive the real SPA against a spawned server and
exercise the path a queued/optimistic user message takes:

    send → optimistic bubble renders immediately → server consumes it
    (``session.input.consumed``) → bubble promotes into committed
    history (not dropped, not duplicated) → survives navigation.

They guard the store wiring this change refactored — the
``session.input.consumed`` promotion in ``chatStore.handleSessionEvent``
and the ``bindStream`` snapshot hydration of ``pendingUserMessages``. A
regression in the promote path (dropping the bubble, double-rendering
it, or popping the wrong pending entry) turns these red.

Scope caveat — read before assuming these cover everything:

The ``pending_inputs`` server-side replay this change adds is
**native-terminal only** (claude-native / codex-native): only those
sessions defer persistence to the transcript forwarder and need the
in-memory replay to survive a rebind. The e2e_ui harness runs an
``openai-agents`` agent (``conftest._TEST_AGENT_YAML``) — native claude
needs the ``claude`` CLI binary + tmux, which this harness doesn't
provide. So on this agent the user message persists at POST time and is
re-loaded from ``items`` on navigation; the native ``pending_inputs``
replay itself is covered by the unit tests
(``tests/runtime/test_pending_inputs.py`` and the ``chatStore``
``session.input.consumed`` / ``bindStream`` suites). What these e2e
tests faithfully verify is the **client** lifecycle (optimistic render,
promote-without-drop-or-dup, queue-while-streaming, navigation
hydration) end-to-end through the real SPA.

User-message bubbles are ``data-testid="message-bubble"`` +
``data-role="user"`` (see ``ChatPage.tsx``). The user's own message
text is deterministic regardless of the LLM's reply, so assertions key
off unique sentinel strings — no dependence on model output.

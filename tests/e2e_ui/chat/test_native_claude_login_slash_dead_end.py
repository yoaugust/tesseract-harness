r"""E2E: ``/login`` from web chat on a claude-native session with an expired login.

On a claude-native session whose Claude Code login has expired, every web
turn answers ``Login expired · Please run /login`` — and typing ``/login``
in the composer cannot fix it, because ``/login`` is in
``_CLAUDE_CLI_DROPPED_COMMANDS`` (``omnigent/harnesses/claude_native/bridge.py``) and
not in ``_CLAUDE_NATIVE_ALLOWED_USER_SLASH_COMMANDS``, so
``_escape_unsupported_slash_command`` prefixes it with U+FEFF and Claude
Code receives it as ordinary prose. The CLI then answers it like any other
prompt — on an expired login, with the very same "Please run /login" line —
silently spending a model turn on the exact command the error told the user
to run.

The journey drives the real claude-native stack (a live ``claude`` CLI in
the session terminal, fed by the in-process mock LLM): the mock plays the
expired-login answer to every turn, the test sends a message and then
``/login`` from the web composer, and asserts the ``/login`` turn is NOT
silently forwarded to the model as escaped prose. Today both observable
halves of the bug fire and the test FAILS:

- the canonical transcript records the composer's ``/login`` as the
  FEFF-escaped user message ``"﻿/login"``, and
- the model receives a request whose user text carries that escaped
  ``"﻿/login"`` (the silently-spent turn).

A fix that intercepts ``/login``/``/logout`` before injection — e.g.
answering with what actually re-authenticates (``omni setup`` on the host,
whose anthropic step runs ``claude auth login --claudeai``) — makes both
checks pass without pinning the fix's exact UI shape.

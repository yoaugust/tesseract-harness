"""Sending a message while only background work is running.

A claude-native turn can settle into the user-visible ``waiting`` state:
the turn already ended and the server's turn gate is free, but background
shells (or a still-running sub-agent) outlive it. The claude/cursor-native
Stop hook reports this as an ``external_session_status`` edge carrying
``status: "waiting"``, the ended turn's ``response_id``, and a positive
``background_task_count``.

The web composer must treat that as free-to-send — a new message starts a
fresh turn immediately — NOT queue it behind the background work. The
regression this guards: the ``waiting``+``response_id`` edge used to force
the local send lifecycle into ``streaming``, so the composer showed
"Send a follow-up (queued)" and held every message in the client-side
queue strip until the background work finished.

Both the live SSE path and the snapshot path are covered. The snapshot one
is the load-bearing case: the server records a background-task ``waiting``
as ``idle`` (the turn ended), so opening the session fresh serves a status
the composer can send against. When it recorded ``waiting``, the snapshot
projection collapsed that to ``running`` while still carrying the ended
turn's ``active_response_id`` — so every fresh open reopened the settled
turn as "streaming" and stranded the composer on the queue until the
background work finished.

Like ``test_working_indicator_background_tasks``, this drives the real
status edge through the Sessions events route (the same path the
claude-native forwarder posts to), so it is deterministic — no live LLM
turn whose timing would make the assertions flaky.

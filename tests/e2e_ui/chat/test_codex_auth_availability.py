"""E2E: auth-aware Codex availability in the New Chat landing screen.

The landing composer (``NewChatLandingScreen`` in
``web/src/shell/NewChatDialog.tsx``) warns — but does not block — when the
selected agent's harness is not ready on the selected host. For Codex the
readiness signal is structured: the host's ``host.hello`` readiness map flows
through ``host_store`` and ``GET /v1/hosts`` as a per-harness
``configured_harnesses`` value of ``"needs-auth"``, ``"binary-missing"``, or
available (absent / ``true``). This PR makes the picker render that distinction:

* the **needs-auth message** under the composer
  (``new-chat-landing-harness-warning``):
  ``"<agent> needs Codex authentication on <host> — run codex login on that
  machine."`` — shown for any selected Codex agent (native or brain harness).
* the **needs-setup badge** (``new-chat-landing-harness-warning-codex``,
  text ``"needs auth"``) on the Codex row inside a bundle agent's per-entry
  "Agent Harness" config submenu.

Why the ``page.route`` stubbing (mirrors
``start_session/test_start_session.py``): the e2e harness's runner tunnels
directly into the server and registers no *host*, so ``GET /v1/hosts`` has
nothing real to return and there is no seam to inject a per-harness readiness
reason server-side. Faking ``/v1/hosts`` (with ``configured_harnesses``) and
``/v1/agents`` is the established way these tests drive the landing picker; it
is also exactly the wire shape the host readiness map produces, so the stub
exercises the real availability/reason → picker rendering path.

The async-in-a-fresh-thread shape is inherited from
``start_session/test_start_session.py`` for the reason documented there: once a
pytest-playwright *sync* test has run in the session, pytest-asyncio can't start
a loop on the main thread, so each async body runs in its own thread via
:func:`asyncio.run`.

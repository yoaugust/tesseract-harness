"""E2E: steering a queued message sends it NOW, mid-turn.

Guards the steer affordance of the client-side queue:

    A first message is sent (and acked), but no ``session.status`` event
    ever follows, so the session's local status stays "streaming"
    (busy). A follow-up typed into the composer is then held in the
    client-side queue — shown in the docked strip, NOT POSTed (the idle
    auto-flush never fires because idle never comes). Clicking the row's
    "Steer" button POSTs it immediately — the only thing that could send
    it here, since the session never went idle.

Why async Playwright (not the sync ``page`` fixture): the route handler
inspects and fulfills every ``/events`` POST to record which messages the
SPA sent and when, across interleaved UI actions (send, queue, steer). It
is a sync test driving the async flow in a fresh thread (see
:func:`_run_in_fresh_loop`) because the suite's many sync
pytest-playwright tests leave the main-thread loop in a state where
pytest-asyncio can't start one.

The route handler fulfills every ``/events`` POST itself, so no real turn
runs and the test needs no working LLM — it asserts purely on when (and
whether) the SPA POSTs the steered message.

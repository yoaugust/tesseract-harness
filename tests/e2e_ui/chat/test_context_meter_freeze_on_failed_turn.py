"""UI journey: the context-occupancy ring must not freeze when a turn fails.

The claude-sdk executor observes the turn's
prompt usage mid-turn (each Anthropic ``message_start`` carries it) but only
emits ``context_tokens`` when the turn completes successfully. A turn that
fails after the model call started (stream death, auth failure, the 240s
watchdog) discards that observed usage, so the UI's context ring stays frozen
at the previous successful turn's value — showing a misleadingly low fill
exactly when the session is in trouble.

Journey driven here, on the real web SPA against a live server + runner and
the real claude CLI pointed at the mock Anthropic endpoint:

1. start a claude-sdk session (spec declares a 200K context window)
2. send a message; the turn succeeds with a small prompt (2,000 tokens)
   → the ring shows ~1%
3. send a second message; the model call STARTS and reports a large prompt
   (100,000 tokens) in ``message_start``, then the turn fails
   (the stream dies mid-flight and the retry is rejected with 401)
4. observable failure: the ring still shows the stale ~1% instead of the
   large fill the harness already observed on the failed turn

Regression guard: the final assertion (ring reflects the failed turn's
observed usage) FAILS on the current build and passes once failed turns
propagate their observed ``context_tokens``.

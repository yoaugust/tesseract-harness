"""Working indicator behavior when the agent is parked on a dialog.

A native-terminal agent can block on a prompt that lives only in its TUI —
a permission request, a sandbox request, an open dialog — which the web
chat does not mirror. The session is still running, so the indicator stays
lit, but a bare rotating "Working…" hides the fact that nothing will move
until someone answers. The status edge carries a ``blocked_on`` reason and
the indicator names it instead.

Drives the real status edges through the Sessions events route (the same
path a native forwarder posts to), so the test is deterministic — no live
LLM turn, whose timing would make the assertions flaky.

"""E2E: mermaid diagrams in chat render, and an un-renderable one degrades.

Streamdown renders mermaid diagrams behind ``React.lazy``. Suspense catches a
*pending* import, not a failed one — a rejected lazy import is re-thrown on
every subsequent render, so without an error boundary above it React unmounts
the whole tree and the user sees a blank page instead of one broken diagram.

The second test aborts the mermaid chunk request, which is the faithful stand-in
for the real-world trigger: a tab holding a stale ``index.html`` after the SPA is
rebuilt, whose hashed mermaid chunk no longer exists on the server.

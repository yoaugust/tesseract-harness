"""E2E: a transient 404 on stream-open self-heals instead of failing the session.

A reverse proxy in front of the server serves 404 for the stream route for the
~10-60s a backend container takes to restart (upgrade, config change, re-seed
bounce). Before this fix the client treated any 404 on stream-open as
permanent and flipped the session to "failed", requiring a manual page reload
to recover. This test simulates a restart window by 404-ing the stream open a
few times before letting it through, and asserts the turn still completes
with no failure banner -- proving the client retried through the transient
window instead of giving up on the first 404.

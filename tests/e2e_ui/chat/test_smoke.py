"""Smoke test: build SPA, spawn server, send a message, see a response.

This is the bootstrap test for ``tests/e2e_ui/`` — it verifies the
full chain (Vite build → static mount → React boot → SSE stream →
DOM render) is wired correctly. It is intentionally minimal; richer
coverage (multi-turn, refresh hydration, stop-cancel, deep-link
errors) lands in follow-up tests once stable selectors are in place.

Selectors are accessibility-first where they're stable: the textarea
is found by its placeholder, the Send button by its accessible name
(a hidden ``<span class="sr-only">Send</span>`` per
``web/src/pages/ChatPage.tsx``). Real message bubbles use
``data-testid="message-bubble"`` + ``data-role={user|assistant}``.
Without the testid we can't distinguish the streaming "Working…"
shimmer (also rendered as ``<Message from="assistant">``) from a
real assistant bubble — the test would pass on the spinner.

    Open a pre-created session, type a prompt, click Send, and assert
    an assistant bubble renders with non-empty text.

    A failure here means one of:

    - The SPA didn't boot (build missing or static mount broken in
      ``omnigent/server/app.py``'s ``_SPAStaticFiles``).
    - The composer is mis-wired (``ChatPage.tsx`` regression).
    - The agent never received the request (server / runtime
      regression — check the live_server log).
    - The LLM never responded (Databricks credentials missing or
      hello_world model unavailable).
    - The SDK reducer didn't render output (TS reducer parity drift
      vs ``omnigent_client/_stream.py`` — see
      ``web/README.md`` § Reducer parity).

    Starts from ``/c/<id>`` rather than ``/`` because the home route
    no longer renders a composer — see :func:`seeded_session`.

"""The main chat Working indicator clears when the server reports idle.

Regression: the indicator reads only ``sessionStatus``, but the
``session.status`` handler used to drop a bare ``idle`` (no ``response_id``)
whenever an ``activeResponse`` was still ``streaming`` — deferring to
``response_end`` to own that lifecycle. ``response_end`` only settles the
local ``status``/``activeResponse``, never ``sessionStatus``, so a dropped
idle stranded the one field the shimmer reads: the server, sidebar, and
local status all reported idle while "Working…" stayed lit.

This drives the exact edge shape the claude-native PTY-activity watcher
emits on a plain turn — a turn-start ``running`` carrying a ``response_id``
(which opens the streaming ``activeResponse``), then a trailing bare
``idle`` with no ``response_id`` once the pane quiesces. The fix makes the
client trust ``session.status`` 1:1, so that bare idle clears Working.

Both edges go through the Sessions events route (the same path the
claude-native forwarder posts to), so the test is deterministic — no live
LLM turn whose timing would make it flaky.

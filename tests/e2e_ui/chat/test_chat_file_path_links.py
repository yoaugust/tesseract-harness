"""E2E: workspace file paths in chat responses render as clickable links.

Regression guard for the home-relative (``~/...``) and absolute path
resolution layered on top of the chat path-linkification feature. A deterministic assistant message
(seeded via the ``external_assistant_message`` event — no LLM run)
mentions three paths in backticks:

  - ``~/<rel>/README.md`` — home-relative, resolves to the workspace root
    file ``README.md`` → link. This is the fix and the exact case the bug
    report hit; it exercises BOTH halves end-to-end: the runner emitting
    ``metadata.home`` and the frontend expanding ``~`` and stripping the root.
  - ``<abs-root>/README.md`` — absolute and under the root, resolves to
    ``README.md`` → link (the absolute-path half of the same fix; was
    rejected outright before).
  - ``/etc/hosts`` — absolute and OUTSIDE the workspace → stays inert code
    (must never linkify).

``~`` expansion can only land inside the workspace when the root is itself
under the runner's home. The default e2e workspace lives under ``$TMPDIR``
(not home), so this test pins the agent's ``os_env.cwd`` to a fresh directory
under ``Path.home()``: with no ``OMNIGENT_RUNNER_WORKSPACE`` set (the e2e
runner inherits none), ``compute_default_env_root`` uses that absolute cwd, so
the root is deterministically under home in both CI and local runs. The tilde
and absolute paths are still derived from the *live* ``metadata.root`` /
``metadata.home`` the runner reports, and the test skips with a clear reason
if the root somehow isn't under home (e.g. an unusual local layout).

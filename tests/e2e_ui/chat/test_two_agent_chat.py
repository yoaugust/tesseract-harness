    Round 2 repeats the shape ("what is the Ultimate Question?"), but MUST
    continue the SAME child session: still exactly one Agents-rail row, and
    the child transcript accumulates both replies (babelfish-<nonce> joins
    vogon-<nonce>).

The user asks Arthur (the session's top-level agent) to find out the Answer
to the Ultimate Question of Life, the Universe, and Everything. Arthur's
prompt forbids answering from his own knowledge; he must `sys_session_send`
the question to his `deep_thought` sub-agent. The sub-agent runs AFTER the
dispatch turn ends, then the inbox auto-wakes Arthur in a continuation turn
that relays the reply into the SPA (the same async dispatch contract
documented in tests/e2e/test_named_sub_agent_persistence.py).

Beyond the relay itself, this journey covers the SPA's multi-agent surfaces,
none of which any other UI test touches:

- the `sys_session_send` tool call rendering in the transcript
  (web/src/components/blocks/ToolCard.tsx);
- the right-rail Agents tab and SubagentsPanel child row + status dot
  (web/src/shell/SubagentsPanel.tsx);
- navigation into the child's own `/c/<child-id>` session and back;
- round 2: a follow-up relayed to the SAME child (named continuation —
  one child row after two rounds, the D6 ambient-hint behavior that was
  previously only API-tested), with the child transcript accumulating
  both exchanges.

The load-bearing assertions are the per-run nonces, which exist ONLY in the
sub-agent's prompt (embedded at registration time by the
`two_agent_chat_session` fixture): `verification_code` in its round-1 Answer
reply and `question_code` in its round-2 Question reply. Any model can say
"42" from world knowledge; the nonces can reach the parent's bubbles only via
the real parent -> sub-agent -> inbox -> parent -> SSE -> UI pipeline.

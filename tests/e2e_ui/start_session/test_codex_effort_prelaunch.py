"""E2E (hermetic): the new-session gear must offer Codex reasoning effort.

When creating a new Codex session in the Web UI, the composer gear's config
modal used to show Model + Approval rows but no reasoning-effort selector,
while the gear of an existing Codex session (the ``composer-config-effort``
row, driven by the same per-model ``supportedReasoningEfforts`` metadata)
does let effort be picked. The new-session composer must expose the Codex
effort selector before the session starts, consistent with the
existing-session composer.

The driving surface is the real SPA in a browser; only the server edges the
landing screen consults (hosts, agents, model-options) are faked, exactly like
the sibling tests in ``test_start_session.py``. The stubbed Codex catalog
advertises per-model effort ladders — the metadata the in-session gear builds
its Effort row from — so the levels are available to the landing screen; the
failure is that the new-session modal never renders a control for them.

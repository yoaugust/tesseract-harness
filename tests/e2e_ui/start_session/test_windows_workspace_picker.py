"""E2E: the New Chat workspace picker on a native Windows host.

On native Windows the workspace picker cannot open a folder
that lives directly under the user profile. Clicking a home-directory
child (e.g. ``work``) is rejected (the listing 404s), and going Up from
that state lands on ``/`` — which the Windows host resolves to the drive
root ``C:\\`` — so sessions started from that state use ``C:\\``.

Unlike the rest of this directory, these tests do NOT stub
``/v1/hosts`` or the filesystem endpoints with ``page.route``: doing so
would bake the expected failure into the stub. Instead a **fake Windows
host** connects over the real host WebSocket tunnel
(``/v1/hosts/{id}/tunnel``) and answers ``host.list_dir`` /
``host.create_dir`` frames with faithful Windows semantics (backslash
``os.scandir`` entry paths, ``~`` expanding to ``C:\\Users\\alice``,
``/`` resolving to the current drive root, ``/C:...`` not existing).
The real server routes and the real SPA then do whatever they do — the
exact production path a Windows machine exercises.

Covered facets (each is a claim from the bug report):

- ``test_windows_home_child_click_navigates_into_folder`` — clicking a
  home child must list that folder's contents (bug: the request becomes
  ``/C:\\Users\\alice\\work`` and 404s, the picker shows an error).
- ``test_windows_up_from_home_child_does_not_fall_to_drive_root`` —
  Up from a home child must return to home, never the drive root (bug:
  the parent of a backslash path computes to ``/`` → ``C:\\``).
- ``test_filesystem_api_addresses_drive_letter_path`` — the browse API
  must be able to address a drive-letter path at all (bug: the route
  always prefixes ``/``, so no Windows path is ever listable).
- ``test_create_directory_accepts_drive_letter_path`` — creating a
  folder under a Windows path must work (bug: the route only accepts
  paths starting with ``/`` or ``~``).

The async-in-a-fresh-thread shape is inherited from
``test_start_session.py`` (pytest-asyncio can't start a loop on the main
thread once a sync pytest-playwright test has run in the session).

"""UI journey: a shared-with viewer leaves a session to clear their sidebar.

Every other sidebar row action is owner-only, so "Leave session" is the one
action a shared-with viewer actually has: it drops their own grant so the
session stops cluttering their sidebar, without touching the owner's copy.

It is not a new menu item — the row's single destructive slot resolves by
ownership. A non-owner previously got **Delete** rendered there permanently
disabled ("only the session owner can delete"), a row that could never do
anything; Leave takes that slot.

The behavior under test:

- A **non-owner** the session is shared with sees an enabled **Leave session**
  in that slot (and NO Delete), and confirming it removes the row from their
  sidebar. Their access is genuinely gone (the session 404s), while the
  **owner still sees it**.
- The **owner** gets **Delete** in the same slot and never Leave — their grant
  is what keeps the session reachable, so leaving would orphan it.

Runs against the dedicated multi-user server for the same reason as
``test_sidebar_ownership_gating``: the shared ``live_server`` is single-user,
which hides sharing affordances entirely, so a leave can't be observed there.
The admin owns the session and a second header identity is granted access via
the REST API.

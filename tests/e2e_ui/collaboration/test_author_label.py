"""E2E: author attribution badge visibility in solo vs shared sessions.

Guards the ``isSessionShared`` gate, the
``created_by`` persistence fix, and the avatar-badge UX
rules from the presence work (``designs/UI/PRESENCE.md``):

- Another contributor's message carries an avatar circle
  (``data-testid="message-author"``, initials on a per-user color)
  whose ``aria-label`` is the author's email — no email text is
  rendered inline.
- Your OWN messages never carry the badge: you know what you sent;
  the badge exists to attribute OTHER people's messages.

Scenario 1 – solo session (no identity):
  A browser context without ``X-Forwarded-Email`` receives
  ``{"user_id": "local"}`` from ``GET /v1/me``.  The frontend's
  ``getCurrentAuthorId()`` maps the reserved ``"local"`` sentinel to
  ``null``, so ``viewerId=null``, ``isSessionSharedWithOthers`` returns
  ``false``, and no ``data-testid="message-author"`` element is rendered.

Scenario 2 – shared session, author's own view vs a peer's view:
  The session is owned by ``"local"`` (created with no header). Alice
  and Bob are granted edit access as the ``"local"`` owner. Alice sends
  a message from her authenticated context: her own bubble must NOT
  carry the badge (self-exclusion), optimistic and committed alike.
  Bob's authenticated context then loads the session: Alice's committed
  bubble MUST carry the badge with her email as the accessible label —
  which also pins that ``created_by`` survived the persistence
  round-trip (the created_by persistence regression).

Scenario 3 – terminal-typed message (``external_conversation_item``):
  Posted as Alice, viewed by Bob — the badge must appear, pinning the
  ``_persist_external_conversation_item`` ``created_by`` fix.

These tests drive the full browser → SPA → server stack against a real
LLM.  They are excluded from the default ``pytest`` run and gated to
``workflow_dispatch`` CI, like the rest of the e2e_ui suite.

Selectors:
  - user bubbles: ``data-testid="message-bubble"`` + ``data-role="user"``
  - author badge: ``data-testid="message-author"`` (avatar beside the
    bubble; ``aria-label`` carries the author email)
  - composer:     placeholder ``"Send a message…"``

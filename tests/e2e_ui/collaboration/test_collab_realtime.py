"""E2E: two browser contexts on one session sync messages in real time.

Two independent browser contexts (owner + collaborator) open the same
``/c/<id>`` URL. The collaborator loads *before* the owner sends, so its
initial snapshot has no message — anything it later renders must have
arrived over the live ``GET /v1/sessions/{id}/stream`` SSE stream, not a
reload. The owner sends a uniquely-marked prompt; the test asserts the
collaborator sees the owner's user bubble appear without reloading, and
that the streamed assistant reply lands in both contexts.

This exercises the cross-client path the single-context smoke test
can't: the server broadcasts ``session.input.consumed`` to every
subscriber, and ``chatStore.handleSessionEvent`` promotes a peer's
consumed event into a user bubble when the local optimistic FIFO is
empty (``web/src/store/chatStore.ts`` ``session_input_consumed``
branch). If either the broadcast or that promotion regresses, the
collaborator never renders the owner's message and this test goes red.

Scope note: only conversation messages broadcast on the session stream.
Comment changes sync over a different channel — the per-session
comments fingerprint on ``WS /v1/sessions/updates`` — and are covered
by ``test_comments_realtime.py``. Filesystem changes still have no live
cross-client sync, so file sync stays out of scope here.

Selectors mirror ``test_smoke``: the composer by placeholder, real
message bubbles by ``data-testid="message-bubble"`` + ``data-role``
(the ``working-indicator`` shimmer is excluded by the role attribute).

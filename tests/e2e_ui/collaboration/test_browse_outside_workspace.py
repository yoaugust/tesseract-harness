"""E2E: browsing outside the workspace is the session OWNER's privilege.

The files panel can navigate anywhere the session can reach. The workspace is
the session's shared context, so a collaborator granted the session sees it —
but everything past the workspace is the owner's own machine, and the
host-scoped filesystem endpoint behind the workspace picker is already
owner-scoped. Gating this route any lower would make a shared session a
weaker way to reach the very same files.

The route-level matrix lives in
``tests/server/routes/test_shell_permission_gate.py``, but it stubs the
permission store. This drives the real thing end to end: one live server, a
real session, a real ``PUT /v1/sessions/{id}/permissions`` grant, and two
browser contexts carrying different identities. If the wiring between a
genuinely shared session and the gate ever broke, the stubs would not notice
and this would.

The decisive assertions are per-identity: the owner's panel offers the
navigation control and lists a file that exists only OUTSIDE the workspace;
the collaborator is not offered the control at all, and the same request over
their own authenticated context is refused. Both layers are asserted on
purpose -- hiding the control is presentation, the 403 is the boundary.

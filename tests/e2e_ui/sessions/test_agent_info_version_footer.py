"""Browser e2e for the agent-info version footer.

The top-right agent-info popover ends with a small version footer:
``server <version>``, plus ``· host <version>`` when the session is bound to
a connected host. This e2e proves the footer renders in the real UI and
surfaces the omnigent server version (from the boot capabilities probe).

The host segment is intentionally not asserted here: the e2e harness binds a
runner but no host tunnel, so the session is not host-bound and the footer
correctly shows the server version alone. Host-version plumbing is covered by
the backend (`tests/server/test_app.py`) and frontend unit suites.

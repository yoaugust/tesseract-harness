"""E2E: ``hosts_changed`` WS frame drives host badge updates without polling.

Two tests that together cover the headline claim of the hosts-push change:

- ``test_hosts_changed_frame_updates_host_badge`` — injecting a
  ``hosts_changed`` frame over the session-updates WS causes the host
  badge to reflect a new host status within the WS round-trip, far
  below the 60 s fallback-poll cadence. A broken push path (frame not
  forwarded by ``_discovery()``, cache not invalidated in
  ``SessionUpdatesProvider``, ``useHosts`` not refetching on invalidate)
  would leave the badge stale until the 60 s poll fires — timing out
  this assertion.

- ``test_host_badge_not_polled_frequently`` — after the page settles,
  ``GET /v1/hosts`` is not called every 10 s. The old code had
  ``refetchInterval: 10_000``; the new code uses 60 s. Zero requests
  during a 12 s observation window distinguishes these (a restored 10 s
  cadence produces at least one).

Route-interception approach mirrors ``test_host_badge.py``:

- ``GET /v1/sessions/{id}`` (snapshot) patched to inject ``host_id`` so
  ``HostBadge`` has a host to resolve.
- ``GET /v1/hosts`` stubbed to a controlled list so the badge name and
  status come from a known payload that the test can swap mid-run.
- ``GET /v1/sessions`` (list) drops the test session so the off-sidebar
  badge renders from the patched snapshot path.
- ``WS /v1/sessions/updates`` intercepted (not connected to the real
  server) so the stream never pushes a live ``host_online`` signal —
  keeping ``liveOnline === undefined`` and letting the badge fall back
  to the ``useHosts`` status field we control. The interceptor stores
  the ``WebSocketRoute`` object so the test can inject a
  ``hosts_changed`` frame at will.
- ``GET /health`` is NOT patched: the live health poll's
  ``runner_online`` / ``host_online`` comes from the real server, but
  since the session is not host-bound there, both fields are absent or
  false — ``useSessionHostOnline`` will be ``undefined`` and won't
  override the ``useHosts``-derived status.

    ``host_online`` for a session it finds — ``null`` when the session
    isn't host-bound — and that ``null`` reaches ``useSessionHostOnline``
    as a live signal, which ``HostBadge`` treats as authoritative
    "unknown" and renders over the ``useHosts`` status this test drives.

    Dropping the id from the ``sessions`` map leaves it *absent* (not
    ``null``), so ``useSessionHostOnline`` stays ``undefined`` — "not
    observed yet" — and the badge falls back to the ``useHosts`` status
    field, exactly as the test intends. This mirrors the snapshot/list
    patches: the browser is placed in a host-bound view whose liveness
    comes solely from the controlled ``useHosts`` payload.

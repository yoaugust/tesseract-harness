"""E2E: a backend-rejected session rename must surface visible failure feedback.

A sidebar rename is optimistic: ``useRenameConversation`` paints the new title
into every cached list in ``onMutate``, then ``PATCH /v1/sessions/{id}``
round-trips. When the PATCH fails, ``onError`` rolls the title back -- but,
unlike a failed delete (which surfaces a persistent toast), it surfaces
*nothing*: the row flickers to the new name and back with no toast and no
validation message, so the user has no idea the rename was rejected.

Deployments whose conversation-store backend restricts title characters hit
this for real: renaming a session to a title containing ``/`` is rejected by
the storage layer (``INVALID_PARAMETER_VALUE: Workspace items cannot contain
the '/' character``) and the UI silently reverts. This test reproduces that
journey against the live server by fulfilling the rename PATCH with that exact
production rejection, then asserts what the user must observe:

- the row does not keep the rejected title (rollback -- correct today), and
- a visible failure signal appears carrying the server's reason and the
  attempted title (toast or alert -- MISSING today, the bug this test
  guards), and
- the server never persisted the rejected title.

The interception is asserted (``expect_response`` sees the 400 and the handler
counts exactly one rejected PATCH) so the test cannot pass or fail vacuously
without the rename ever leaving the client.

"""Browser e2e: the session filter re-scopes only the flat Sessions list.

The sidebar's session filter (the funnel: All / My sessions / Shared / Archived)
picks a slice of conversations, but the **Pinned** and **Projects** sections are
built from the full non-archived set — NOT the filtered slice — so switching the
filter must never empty them:

- **Pinned** shows EVERY pinned session on every filter. A pinned *shared*
  session (owned by someone else) stays under Pinned on "My sessions", and a
  pinned *owned* session stays under Pinned on "Shared sessions"; both survive
  the "Archived sessions" filter too. Pins are per-user, so the viewer's own pin
  set drives this regardless of who owns the session.
- **Projects** renders the same folders and contents on every filter. Filing is
  owner-only, so a folder shows the viewer's owned sessions — but the group and
  its folders must not vanish when the filter switches to Shared or Archived.

These drive the real chain the mocked ``Sidebar`` unit tests exercise, but
end-to-end: seed owned + shared sessions (and a filed project) over the REST
API, pin/file through the live UI, toggle the filter, and assert the Pinned /
Projects sections hold their rows. Runs against a dedicated multi-user server
(the shared ``live_server`` is single-user, which hides the Shared filter), the
same harness as ``test_sidebar_ownership_gating.py``.

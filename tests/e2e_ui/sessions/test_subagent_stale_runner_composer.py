"""E2E: a sub-agent session with a dead runner keeps the composer open.

When a sub-agent's runner dies (idle timeout, crash), the session must NOT
show the "Agent disconnected — click to reconnect" banner or disable the
composer.  Sub-agents have no host binding and can't be relaunched from a CLI
command — they recover via their parent's live runner transparently on message
send (server-side heal, #3151).

Before the fix the liveness hook classified them as ``local_stranded`` (same as
a dead CLI session), which blocked the composer and opened the CLI reconnect
modal.  After the fix ``kind == "sub_agent"`` maps to ``runner_asleep`` instead,
keeping the composer enabled.

The fixture creates a real parent session, then creates a child session with
``parent_session_id`` set (which the server records as ``kind="sub_agent"``).
The browser's view of the child is then patched via route interception to look
like its runner is offline — the same conditions that triggered the bad modal.

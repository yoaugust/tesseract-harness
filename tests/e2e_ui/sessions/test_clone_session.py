"""Browser e2e for the Clone session flow (ForkSessionDialog).

Drives the real chain the unit layer can't: per-message "Fork from
here" action → Radix dialog → ``POST /v1/sessions/{id}/fork`` → close +
navigate into the clone → the copied transcript renders from the fork's
snapshot. (The desktop header has no Clone button — the per-message
action is the desktop entry point; mobile keeps a three-dot menu entry.)

The seeded session is runner-bound with no workspace, so the dialog takes
the non-coding path (plain "Clone", no host/directory picker, no runner
launch). The host-bound "Clone & start" variant needs a connected
``omnigent host`` daemon this harness doesn't spawn, so the worktree test
below stubs the host-side wire (hosts list, filesystem pre-flight, runner
launch) at the network layer instead and drives the real dialog against
it; the remaining launch pieces are covered by the dialog unit tests
(background launch + error handoff to ``useForkLaunchStore``) and the
``ResumeWithDirectoryDialog`` ``initialError`` test.

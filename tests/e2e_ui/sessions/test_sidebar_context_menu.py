"""Browser e2e for the sidebar row right-click context menu.

Right-clicking a session row opens the same actions as the row kebab
(three-dots) — Share / Rename / Add-to-project / Stop / Archive / Delete —
positioned at the cursor. Both menus render from a single shared item body
(``ConversationMenuItems`` in ``Sidebar.tsx``), one under a Radix
``DropdownMenu`` (the kebab) and one under a Radix ``ContextMenu`` (this
right-click path).

This guards the wiring the mocked unit test can't exercise end-to-end:

- The native browser context menu is suppressed (``ContextMenuTrigger``
  preventDefaults the ``contextmenu`` event) and the app menu opens instead.
- Right-clicking does NOT navigate, and the same item handlers run — picking
  Rename here swaps the row for the inline edit field, exactly as the kebab's
  Rename does.

"""E2E: the composer's host badge shows which host a session is bound to.

The badge (``web/src/components/HostBadge.tsx``) renders in the composer's
status-line tray for a host-bound session: the friendly host name (or a
sandbox-provider label) plus a green/red status dot driven by the live host
``host_online`` signal. It renders nothing when the session isn't host-bound.

A DISCONNECTED host keeps that exact shape — name + red dot — and becomes
clickable, opening the reconnect instructions. That one shape is the point: the
badge must not swap the host's name for generic "Host is offline" copy in some
disconnect states and keep it in others, which is what it used to do depending
on whether the runner happened to outlive the host (see the reconnect tests
below). A dormant *resumable* managed host is the deliberate exception: its
offline is idle dormancy the next message wakes, so it gets no reconnect
affordance.

Clicking a badge that has nothing to reconnect opens ``SwitchHostDialog``
instead, which moves the session to another machine — covered at the bottom of
this module.

The harness seeds a normal runner-bound ``hello_world`` session, so the browser
view is patched into a host-bound shape via route interception (same approach as
``test_host_asleep_composer.py``):

- ``GET /v1/sessions/{id}`` (snapshot) → ``host_id`` set so the badge has a host
  to resolve, plus ``host_resumable`` and an old ``created_at`` (past the
  ``STARTING_GRACE_S`` startup window).
- ``GET /v1/hosts`` → returns the bound host so the badge resolves its name (or
  the sandbox-provider label). ``HostBadge`` calls this via
  ``useHosts({ includeSandbox: true })``.
- ``GET /health`` → reports the session's live ``runner_online`` /
  ``host_online`` so the dot reads online/offline; the open-session poll
  overrides the WS stream.
- ``GET /v1/sessions`` (sidebar list) → the session is dropped so the open row
  resolves off-sidebar from the patched snapshot (host-bound).
- ``WS /v1/sessions/updates`` → blocked so a stream push can't revert liveness to
  the real (runner-online, host-unbound) values.

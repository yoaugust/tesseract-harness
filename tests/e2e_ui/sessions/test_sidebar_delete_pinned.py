"""Browser e2e for deleting a *pinned* session from the sidebar.

The Pinned section renders from a query cache (``["pinned-conversations"]``)
that is a deliberate sibling of the paginated ``["conversations"]`` list, so
the delete mutation's prefix-matched sweep over ``["conversations"]`` does not
touch it (see ``useConversations.ts`` — nesting the pinned key under that
prefix would break the pin-toggle's own cache patch). The delete handlers must
therefore drop the row from the pinned cache *explicitly*.

The regression this guards: they didn't, so deleting a pinned session removed
it from the flat list but left its row stranded in the "Pinned" section until a
full reload.

Two harness details are load-bearing here — without them a green test would
prove nothing:

  - The page sits on ``/`` (no active chat). Deleting the *open* session
    bounces the SPA to ``/`` and refetches, and a live ``WS /v1/sessions/updates``
    ``removed`` frame reconciles an active session's list too — either path
    clears the Pinned row regardless of the cache bug.
  - No ``page.reload()``. A reload refetches ``?pinned=true`` and converges the
    section on its own. Only an in-place assertion isolates the delete handler's
    own pinned-cache patch — the code under test.

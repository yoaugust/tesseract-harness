"""Browser e2e: a stopped session surfaces the reconnect affordance.

What "stop session" looks like to the user is the agent going away: the
runner tunnel drops, the open chat flips to ``local_stranded`` liveness
(not host-bound → no host to relaunch it), and the composer area swaps in
the "Agent disconnected — click to reconnect" banner
(``data-testid="disconnected-indicator"``). Clicking it opens the
reconnect dialog with the exact ``omnigent run … --resume <id>`` command
to bring the session back from the user's own machine.

The e2e harness binds a tunneled, non-host runner, so the sidebar kebab's
"Stop session" item — gated to host-spawned / claude-native sessions by
``isSessionStoppable`` — isn't offered, and a forwarded ``stop_session``
is a no-op for the openai-agents harness (no external process, and only
host-spawned sessions stop their runner). The observable that the same
liveness chain produces is reproduced here by dropping the runner
directly, then asserting the disconnected → click → reconnect-dialog flow
(the dialog half is not covered by ``test_stale_stream``, which kills the
runner mid-stream and only checks the banner text).

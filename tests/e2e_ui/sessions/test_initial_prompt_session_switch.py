"""E2E: a new chat's initial prompt never leaks into another session.

Guards the initial-prompt cross-session leak (sibling of the queued-
message regression in ``test_cross_session_routing``, but a different
code path):

    The user opens the home composer ("New session"), types an initial
    prompt for a brand-new session A, and creates it. The prompt
    auto-sends to A (its runner is online), but the held prompt state is
    NOT cleared while the user stays on A. The user then clicks an
    already-running session B in the sidebar. The held prompt MUST stay
    bound to A — it must never be POSTed into B (which would deliver a
    duplicate of A's prompt to B).

Root cause it catches (an effect-ordering race in ``ChatPage``): the
consume effect (``setInitialPrompt(...)``) and the auto-send effect both
key off ``urlConvId``. The prompt auto-sends to A once A's runner is
online, but the held prompt state is NOT cleared while the user stays on
A. So on the A→B switch the auto-send effect re-runs in the same commit
with the STALE prompt (consumed for A) while ``urlConvId`` is already B
and B's runner reads online. ``send()`` then pins the live store id —
already B — and a DUPLICATE of A's prompt floods B. (The same race also
leaks when A's runner is still offline at switch time; this test drives
the runner-online variant because it needs no health stubbing.) The fix
binds the prompt to the conversation it was consumed for and gates the
auto-send on a match (``shouldSendInitialPrompt``'s ``promptConversationId``).

The composer needs a host + agent catalog the headless harness can't
produce (its runner is directly tunneled, no host daemon), and the
create POST would really launch a runner. So the host list, the agent
catalog, and the create POST are stubbed via ``page.route`` — the REAL
composer still performs the REAL ``setPendingInitialPrompt`` + ``navigate``
handoff into a REAL, pre-seeded session A. ``/events`` is intercepted
(like the sibling test) so no real turn runs and the assertion is purely
on where each POST is addressed. The async-in-a-fresh-thread shape and
the sidebar (client-side) navigation are inherited from
``test_cross_session_routing`` for the same reasons documented there.

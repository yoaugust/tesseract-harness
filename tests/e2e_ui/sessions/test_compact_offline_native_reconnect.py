"""E2E: /compact on a disconnected native session shows the reconnect hint.

A native-terminal (claude-native) session compacts only in its vendor TUI, so
when its runner is offline the server can't run server-side compaction. Rather
than the old confusing "agent declares no LLM model" error, ``/compact`` now
surfaces an actionable message telling the user to reconnect (send a message to
wake the runner) first. This drives that client contract end to end: on a
native-wrapper session, typing ``/compact`` and submitting posts the compact
control, and the composer renders the server's reconnect error inline.

The e2e harness binds a real *online* ``openai-agents`` runner, not a native
one with a sleeping sandbox, so the server-side auto-wake path itself is covered
by ``tests/server/integration/test_sessions_compact.py``. Here the browser's
view is patched into a native-wrapper session and the compact ``POST`` is
intercepted to return the exact 503 envelope the server change produces, so the
test exercises the real client ``/compact`` → error-render path.

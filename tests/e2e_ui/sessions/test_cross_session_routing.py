"""E2E: a queued message is delivered to its origin session, never another.

Guards cross-session message routing under the client-side queue +
background-flush model:

    Session B is busy (its first message's POST is held open, so B stays
    "streaming"), so a follow-up typed into B is held in B's client-side
    queue — NOT POSTed. The user switches to a different, idle session A.
    Once B's turn settles and B reads idle, **background flush** delivers
    the queued message to B — its origin — even though A is now active. It
    must go to B and never leak into A.

The queue is a per-conversation client-side buffer keyed by ``conversationId``;
``flushBackgroundQueues`` POSTs a queued message to its own conversation when
that conversation is idle in the ``["conversations"]`` cache, regardless of
which session is being viewed. These tests pin both halves: delivered-to-B and
never-to-A — once for a plain-text follow-up, and once for a follow-up carrying
an image (upload → ``input_image`` post, both addressed to B). (The FIFO/idle
unit behavior is covered by the ``chatStore`` tests.)

A third test pins the other side of that isolation: a send whose POST never
settles must not wedge a DIFFERENT session. POSTs are serialized through a
client-side ordering chain, and while that chain was one per tab a single
stalled POST blocked every later send in every conversation — silently, with
a page reload as the only recovery.

Why async Playwright (not the sync ``page`` fixture): the test inspects the
body of every ``/events`` POST via a route handler and asserts on which
session each was addressed to, across interleaved UI actions (send, switch
sessions, switch back). The route handler fulfills every POST itself, so no
real turn runs and the test needs no working LLM. It is a sync test driving
the async flow in a fresh thread (see :func:`_run_in_fresh_loop`) because the
suite's many sync pytest-playwright tests leave the main-thread loop in a
state where pytest-asyncio can't start one. Session switches are driven via
the in-app sidebar link (client-side navigation), NOT ``page.goto`` — a full
reload would reset the JS module state (the client-side queue lives in the
store) and dissolve the scenario under test.

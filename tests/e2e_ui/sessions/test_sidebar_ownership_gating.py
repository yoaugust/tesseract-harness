"""Browser e2e for the sidebar's owner-vs-not row gating and scope filters.

This is the end-to-end companion to the mocked ``Sidebar`` unit tests, and the
coverage the ``E2E UI Required`` gate asks for: the sidebar derives ownership
(and every owner-only row action) from the session's ``owner`` — the creator's
user id carried on each list row — NOT from an effective ``permission_level``.
The behavior under test:

- A session's **owner** sees it, with the
  kebab's **Rename** and **Share** items **enabled**.
- A **non-owner the session is shared with** (even at EDIT) sees it under the
  **"Shared sessions"** filter, with **Rename** and **Share** **disabled**
  ("Only the session owner can …"). Editing shared *content* still happens in
  the open session — that path reads the real level from the single-session
  snapshot and is unaffected — but the sidebar affordances are owner-only.

Runs against a dedicated multi-user server: the shared ``live_server`` is
single-user (``OMNIGENT_LOCAL_SINGLE_USER=1``), which hides the Shared filter
AND the Share item entirely, so the ownership split can't be observed there.
The multi-user server clears that marker and declares an admin identity, exactly
like a Databricks Apps / SSO-proxy install — the deployment shape this gating
matters for.

The admin owns the session; a second header identity (the viewer) is granted
access via the REST API. Both identities' sidebar list loads via the initial
``GET /v1/sessions`` (a plain authenticatedFetch that carries the context's
``X-Forwarded-Email``), so the static post-load state asserted here is
deterministic — unlike the ``WS /v1/sessions/updates`` push, which the
sharing-journey test notes may not carry the header in all Chromium combos and
which this test deliberately does not depend on.

"""E2E: the ``WS /v1/sessions/updates`` push stream drives the sidebar.

This commit replaced the sidebar's 4 s HTTP poll of ``GET /v1/sessions``
with a client-driven WebSocket: the browser sends the session ids it's
showing and the server pushes ``snapshot`` / ``changed`` / ``removed``
frames as those sessions change. The two tests here cover the two halves
of that claim against a real server + real browser:

- ``test_session_rename_streams_to_open_tabs`` — a *third* client (the
  test, standing in for a CLI or another UI) renames a watched session
  over the API, and both already-open tabs reflect it **fast**, with no
  reload. "Fast" is the whole point: with the 4 s poll gone, the only
  path that delivers a change within a few seconds is the push stream —
  the HTTP fallback poll now runs at 45-60 s, far outside the assertion
  window. So a broken stream (handshake rejected, watch-set never sent,
  delta never pushed, cache merge regressed) makes this time out.

- ``test_idle_sidebar_does_not_poll_sessions_list`` — an idle sidebar
  generates no ``GET /v1/sessions`` list traffic over an observation
  window. This guards the headline win (the poll flood is gone); a
  regression that restored ``refetchInterval: 4000`` would light it up.

Selectors: the sidebar renders each session as ``<a href="/c/{id}">``
whose text is the session title (``web/src/shell/Sidebar.tsx`` — the
``Link to={`/c/${conversation.id}`}`` row). The default pytest-playwright
viewport (1280×720) is desktop, so the sidebar is shown without a toggle.

    A failure means one of:

    - The updates WebSocket never connected / was rejected at handshake,

    - The client never derived the watch-set from its cached rows or
      never sent it (``SessionUpdatesProvider`` regression).
    - The server didn't diff the rename into a ``changed`` frame, or the
      client didn't merge it / trigger the title reconcile
      (``_emit_deltas`` / ``mergeItemsIntoPages`` regression).

    If the stream were dead the rename would still surface — but only via

"""Build-output guard: the embed island ships no service worker.

The **embed island** must ship no service worker or web manifest: it is mounted
inside a host application (e.g. Databricks), so it must never register a worker
or precache anything — a regression that added one would hijack the host page's
origin with our service worker. This invariant outlived the retired PWA and its
tombstone ``sw.js`` (removed in 0.11.0): the embed island must ship neither.

Note: icons under ``public/`` *are* copied into the embed output (Vite copies
``publicDir`` for every build) — but they are inert images. Only a service worker
or web manifest could affect the host's origin, so those (plus the ``workbox-``
runtime) are precisely what this guard forbids.

Part of the gated e2e suite (needs ``npm`` + a vite build); see this package's
``conftest`` module docstring for how the suite is run and excluded from the
default ``pytest`` run.

"""E2E: the "+" → Shell affordance stays usable on a runner-asleep session.

When the web app believes a session's runner is offline but its host is up
(``runner_asleep`` liveness), the "+" ("Open new") menu must keep the "Shell"
item enabled — a wakeable session reconnects on create rather than dead-ending
on a disabled button or a "no runner available" 502. This pins the frontend
half of that behavior (``NewTabMenu`` in ``web/src/shell/WorkspacePanel.tsx``):
picking Shell while the UI reads runner-offline still opens a working shell.

Scope / honesty about the harness: the runner really is alive server-side here
(only the browser's *view* of liveness is patched runner-offline via
``/health``), so the create route's wake ladder (``ensure_runner_connected`` in
``_sessions/orchestration.py``) fast-paths on the live runner — the server-side
relaunch itself is NOT exercised (that needs host/managed-sandbox infrastructure
this harness doesn't stand up; it's covered by the backend unit test
``tests/server/routes/test_ensure_runner_connected.py``). What this proves is
the user-visible guard: perceived runner-offline liveness does not block shell
creation from the UI. The complementary "genuinely offline / can't reconnect
from the web" branch (Shell disabled + "Offline") is a pure frontend gate
covered by vitest (``web/src/shell/WorkspacePanel.test.tsx``).

Mirrors the liveness patching in ``files/test_offline_runner_host_served.py``
and ``sessions/test_host_badge.py``.

"""Visual-regression snapshot of a *populated* sidebar ("/").

The empty-landing baseline (``test_landing_snapshot.py``) stubs the session list
empty, so its sidebar only ever shows the top nav + "No sessions" — the
row-alignment surface (section headers, flat session rows, project folders and
their nested chats) is never rendered, so a padding regression there sails
through the gate. This baseline fills that gap: a fixed session list that lays
out every sidebar row type on one capture — a Pinned row, a "Projects" group with
an expanded folder (a nested chat) and an empty folder, and a flat "Sessions"
list including the "needs response" and running state badges.

Same gate, renderer, and update flow as the other snapshots — see ``README.md``.

Determinism strategy — the sidebar is a pure function of the committed bundle
plus ``page.route`` stubs and two extra pins, mirroring the landing:

* The main session list (``GET /v1/sessions``) and the per-project list
  (``?project=``) return fixed fixtures; ``GET /v1/sessions/projects`` names the
  two folders. Every row carries ``comments_count: 0`` so no per-row comment
  fetch mounts.
* Row timestamps are relative ("2h ago") and would drift, so the clock is pinned
  with ``page.clock.set_fixed_time`` to a fixed "now" a known distance past each
  row's ``updated_at`` — the rendered pill text is then constant.
* The ``WS /v1/sessions/updates`` socket would stream per-row field patches
  (badge/timestamp churn), so it's routed to a no-op that accepts the connection
  and never sends a frame.
* Pinned membership and the expanded-folder set are localStorage, seeded before
  boot so the Pinned section and the open "Moonshot" folder render on first
  paint.

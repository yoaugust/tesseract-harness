"""Visual-regression snapshot of the default empty view ("/").

A single committed baseline of the whole app shell at ``/`` -- the open left
sidebar plus the ``NewChatLandingScreen`` ("What should we build?") hero and
composer. The gate lives in ``.github/workflows/ui-snapshot.yml``, which renders
inside a *digest-pinned Playwright image* so the committed baseline and the PR
comparison come from the exact same renderer (screenshots differ across
rendering environments; no diff threshold reconciles two engines, so CI is the
single source of truth). See ``tests/e2e_ui/visual/README.md`` for how to update
the baseline (label the PR, or regenerate locally with Docker).

The test is marked ``@pytest.mark.visual`` so the main e2e_ui suite (which runs
on the unpinned ``ubuntu-latest``) excludes it via ``-m 'not visual'``; only the
dedicated pinned gate runs it.

Determinism strategy -- mock every HTTP call the landing makes:

``live_server`` still serves the built SPA bundle (and the WebSocket session
feed, which on a fresh server is empty), but the rendered *data* is volatile and
async: the agent catalog, host list, and session list arrive after mount, so a
naive capture races them (the picker flips from "No agents" to a real agent, the
sidebar from "Loading..." to "No sessions"). Rather than wait-and-mask each one,
we ``page.route``-stub the landing's HTTP endpoints with fixed
fixtures (same pattern as ``tests/e2e_ui/start_session``). That makes the view a
pure function of the committed bundle + these stubs, so the snapshot needs no
masks: the host/workspace/agent chips render fixed, known values. ``/v1/info`` /
``/v1/me`` are left to the (deterministic) real server.

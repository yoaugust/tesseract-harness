# UI diff snapshot tests

Committed visual-regression baselines for full app pages and opted-in Storybook
component states, each captured at 1280×800 with the color scheme pinned to
`light` and gated together in CI.

Each page's data calls are stubbed via `page.route` with fixed fixtures, so the
rendered view is a pure function of the committed bundle and needs no element
masking. `live_server` still serves the SPA bundle; only `/v1/info` / `/v1/me`
reach the real (and deterministic) server. The shared bits (fixed viewport +
light palette, the JSON-route helper, the pre-capture fonts/caret settle) live in
[`conftest.py`](conftest.py), so each `test_*_snapshot.py` only declares its own
stubs.

Pages covered:

- **Empty landing (`/`)** — the open left sidebar plus the `NewChatLandingScreen`
  ("What should we build?") hero and composer.
  [`test_landing_snapshot.py`](test_landing_snapshot.py)
- **Chat conversation (`/c/{id}`)** — a fully-mocked one-turn transcript (user
  question + assistant markdown reply) rendered as message bubbles, with the
  composer below. [`test_chat_snapshot.py`](test_chat_snapshot.py)
- **Multi-turn chat with TurnRail (`/c/{id}`)** — a fully-mocked several-turn
  transcript that mounts the left-edge tick minimap (the rail only renders for
  two or more turns), guarding the spacing between the transcript column and the
  rail. [`test_chat_turn_rail_snapshot.py`](test_chat_turn_rail_snapshot.py)
- **Storybook component states** — every story tagged `visual-snapshot` in the
  generated Storybook index is rendered through `iframe.html` and parameterized
  as an independent snapshot case.
  [`test_storybook_snapshot.py`](test_storybook_snapshot.py)

Baselines are committed under `snapshots/<test_module>/<test_name>/<name>[chromium][linux].png`.

- Gate workflow: [`.github/workflows/ui-snapshot.yml`](../../../.github/workflows/ui-snapshot.yml)
- Local regen (Docker): [`regen_baseline_docker.sh`](regen_baseline_docker.sh)
- Plugin: [`pytest-playwright-visual-snapshot`](https://github.com/iloveitaly/pytest-playwright-visual-snapshot)

## Why a single pinned renderer

Screenshots differ across rendering environments (font rasterizer, hinting,
anti-aliasing), and no diff threshold can reconcile two rendering engines. So we
render everywhere in **one** environment: a digest-pinned Playwright image
(`mcr.microsoft.com/playwright/python`, which bakes in Chromium + fonts). CI
renders in it, and you can reproduce that exact render locally with Docker — see
[Updating the baseline](#updating-the-baseline). Because the renderer is the
image, your host OS doesn't matter; you just need Docker (or let CI do it).

The test is marked `@pytest.mark.visual`; the main e2e-ui suite (unpinned
`ubuntu-latest`) excludes it via `-m "not visual"`. Only `ui-snapshot.yml` runs
it.

## Is this check merge-blocking?

The check **`UI Snapshot (visual baselines)`** is **merge-blocking**: it's listed
in the repo's required-checks set (`.github/scripts/merge-ready/required.sh`, in
both `REQUIRED` and `ALLOW_SKIP`). A drift against the committed baseline fails
the check and blocks the merge until the baseline is regenerated (label the PR —
see below) or the UI change is reverted.

It's **safe to register as required**: a PR that touches none of the render
inputs skips the render via the `detect` job's `if` gate, and a job skipped by
`if` reports **success** — so non-UI PRs satisfy the check instead of sitting
"pending" (which is what an `on: paths:` filter would cause, blocking merges).

## How the gate behaves

- On every PR that touches a render input (web, the visual tests + fixtures,
  or the pinned toolchain — see the `detect` job in `ui-snapshot.yml`),
  `ui-snapshot.yml` builds the SPA and Storybook, then renders each page and
  tagged story and compares it to its committed baseline.
  Any pixel difference on any page fails the check; PRs that touch none of those
  skip the render (reported as a passing skip).
- **Every run (pass or fail)** uploads one artifact and links it in the job
  summary, so the screenshots are always one click away:
  `ui-snapshot-<run_id>` carries this run's renders (`snapshots/`); on a mismatch
  `snapshot_failures/` also holds the `expected_` (baseline), `actual_`
  (current) and `diff_` PNGs for each failing page. That single artifact is
  baseline + current + diff.
- The baselines are **never** changed by the compare gate. The only ways to
  change them are the update flows below.

## Updating the baseline

When a UI change is intentional, pick whichever path fits — all render in the
pinned image, so the result matches the gate. The label and Docker paths rewrite
**only** the baselines that drift (or are missing) and leave already-passing ones
byte-for-byte untouched. Review each changed image before committing.

### Same-repo branch — label the PR (recommended)

1. Push your branch and open the PR.
2. Add the **`update-ui-snapshot`** label.
   [`ui-snapshot-update.yml`](../../../.github/workflows/ui-snapshot-update.yml)
   re-renders in the same pinned image, regenerates only the baselines that drift
   (or are missing) — passing ones are left untouched — and commits the changed
   PNGs back to your branch, then removes the label and comments the result.
3. **Review the committed PNG(s)** in the bot's commit.
4. The bot pushes with the `OMNIGENT_BOT_APP` token, so the push re-fires the
   PR's checks automatically — no manual re-run. (If the App isn't configured it
   falls back to `GITHUB_TOKEN`, which won't re-trigger CI; the bot's comment
   says so and you push any commit to re-run.)

This works for **same-repo branches only** — Actions tokens can't push to a fork.

### Anywhere with Docker — regenerate locally (works for forks)

```bash
tests/e2e_ui/visual/regen_baseline_docker.sh
```

This renders inside the exact pinned image CI uses, so the PNGs it writes match
the gate byte-for-byte. Only Docker is required (it builds the SPA in a Node
container, then renders the suite and rewrites only the baselines that drift —
passing ones stay untouched). **Review the image(s)**, then commit and push —
your push re-runs the checks. Pass `--skip-build` to reuse an existing `web`
build.

### Fork PR without Docker — adopt the run's render

The failing compare run already rendered your change in the pinned image, and
because it runs under GitHub Actions the plugin rewrote each drifting baseline
**in place** under `snapshots/`. Pull that tree in:

```bash
tests/e2e_ui/visual/update_baseline_from_pr.sh <pr-number>
```

It finds the PR's UI Snapshot run, downloads the artifact, and restores its
runner-rendered `snapshots/` tree over the committed baselines — only the
drifting ones differ. **Review the image(s)**, then commit and push. (Manual
equivalent: download the `ui-snapshot-<run_id>` artifact and commit its
`snapshots/` tree over `tests/e2e_ui/visual/snapshots/`.)

### Workflow dispatch (non-PR branches)

GitHub → Actions → **UI Snapshot** → **Run workflow**, set `ref` to your branch
(CLI: `gh workflow run ui-snapshot.yml -f ref=<your-branch>`). It runs with
`--update-snapshots` (intentionally fails); the regenerated PNG is in the
`ui-snapshot-<run_id>` artifact to download, review, and commit. Any collaborator
can dispatch against an arbitrary `ref`, but since the PNG is human-reviewed
before it lands, an unreviewed ref can't change the baseline on its own.

### Failure comments

Whenever the check fails (same-repo or fork),
[`ui-snapshot-fail-comment.yml`](../../../.github/workflows/ui-snapshot-fail-comment.yml)
upserts a PR comment pointing back to these paths. It runs as `workflow_run` so
it can comment without ever executing PR/fork code, which means it only activates
once merged to `main` (it does not fire on its own PR).

## Adding a Storybook component snapshot

1. Add a co-located `ComponentName.stories.tsx` using Component Story Format.
2. Model meaningful visual states as separate named story exports with fixed,
   deterministic data.
3. Add `tags: ["visual-snapshot"]` to the story metadata only when every story
   in that file is stable enough for pixel comparison. Stories without the tag
   remain available for development but are not added to the snapshot gate.
4. Run `pnpm --filter web run storybook` to inspect the states, then regenerate
   and review the pinned-renderer PNGs using one of the update flows above.

Removing, renaming, or untagging a story makes the gate reject its stale PNG.
The pinned update flows remove those orphaned baselines from the restored tree.

The shared Storybook preview imports the app styles and provides theme and
Tooltip contexts. Add narrowly scoped per-story decorators for other providers;
do not make stories depend on a live backend.

## Adding a new page snapshot

Each page is one `@pytest.mark.visual` test in its own `test_<page>_snapshot.py`.
The gate, the update flows, and the artifact already cover every test in this
directory, so a new page is just a test + its committed baseline — no workflow
changes.

1. Add `test_<page>_snapshot.py`. Take `snapshot_page` (fixed viewport + light
   palette), `live_server`, `fulfill_json`, `settle_for_snapshot`, and
   `assert_snapshot` from [`conftest.py`](conftest.py).
2. `page.route`-stub **every** call the page makes so the view is a pure function
   of the bundle — no real backend data, no live stream. Drive any dynamic data
   from fixed fixtures; the chat test ([`test_chat_snapshot.py`](test_chat_snapshot.py))
   is the worked example (mocked session/items/agent/health + a `[DONE]` stream).
   Watch for non-determinism: relative timestamps, streaming, working shimmers,
   randomized ids.
3. Navigate, wait for the page's content to finish painting (a stable selector,
   not a timer), call `settle_for_snapshot(page)`, then `assert_snapshot(page)`.
4. Generate the baseline in the pinned image — label the PR or run
   `regen_baseline_docker.sh` — then **review the PNG** and commit it.

## Running locally without Docker (debugging only — never commit the result)

You can exercise the test on the host to debug it, but a baseline rendered
anywhere other than the pinned image will not match the gate, so **never commit
a PNG produced this way** — a stray `git add -A` would commit a wrong-renderer
baseline and break CI. Use the Docker path above to produce a committable PNG.

```bash
uv sync --extra all --group test
uv run --no-sync playwright install --with-deps chromium
pnpm install --frozen-lockfile --filter web
pnpm --filter web run build
pnpm --filter web run build:storybook
# First run with no baseline creates one (and fails); subsequent runs compare:
uv run --no-sync pytest tests/e2e_ui/visual -m visual --ui-skip-build
```

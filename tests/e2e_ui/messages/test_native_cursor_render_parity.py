r"""UI journey: a native Cursor session renders parity with its TUI.

The native ``cursor-native`` ("Cursor") wrapper is terminal-first: a real
``cursor-agent`` CLI runs in the session terminal, the SPA's **Terminal** view
attaches to that live TUI over a WebSocket, and the SPA's **Chat** view renders
the SAME canonical transcript (``GET /v1/sessions/{id}/items``) the TUI prints.
A native forwarder (:mod:`omnigent.harnesses.cursor_native.forwarder`) tails
``cursor-agent``'s own chat store and mirrors the transcript back OUT as
conversation items; web-composer messages are injected INTO the TUI's tmux pane
by :class:`omnigent.inner.cursor_native_executor.CursorNativeExecutor`. This
suite asserts that round-trips both ways and renders exactly once — the same
three properties the codex/claude native forwarders are pinned against
(:mod:`tests.e2e_ui.messages.test_native_codex_render_parity`):

1. **Render parity with the TUI.** Composer turns are sent through the web SPA;
   each per-turn user marker and assistant token the SPA shows in a bubble must
   also appear in the canonical transcript, in the same order, exactly once.

2. **A TUI-originated message surfaces in the web UI.** A turn is typed directly
   into the Cursor TUI (the embedded xterm in the Terminal view) — never through
   the composer. The forwarder must mirror it back out as a user item +
   assistant reply, so switching to Chat shows both as bubbles.

3. **No duplicate rendering.** Every marker/token — composer- and TUI-originated
   alike — must land in EXACTLY ONE bubble and one transcript entry.

How this differs from the claude/codex render-parity suites
-----------------------------------------------------------
Claude Code and Codex derive their model auth from the runner's own Databricks
gateway credentials (CI exchanges Databricks OAuth before pytest), so those
suites run unconditionally in CI. ``cursor-agent`` has **no Databricks-gateway
path** — it talks only to Cursor's backend and authenticates from the ambient
``cursor-agent login`` (``$HOME/.cursor``) or an ambient ``CURSOR_API_KEY``.
Because CI does not provision a Cursor account by default, this suite is **gated
to skip** when ``cursor-agent`` is absent or no usable Cursor login is present
(see :func:`_cursor_unavailable_reason`); it runs for real wherever Cursor is
logged in (a dev box, or a CI job that installs ``cursor-agent`` and provides a
``CURSOR_API_KEY`` secret). The ``native_cursor_session`` fixture launches the
TUI with ``-f`` so the unattended tmux pane never blocks on Cursor's
workspace-trust / per-tool approval prompts.

CI coverage without a Cursor account
------------------------------------
Because the live test above skips wherever Cursor is not logged in — i.e. on
every PR — :func:`test_native_cursor_mirror_renders_without_live_agent` covers
the same Omnigent-owned half (the forwarder mirroring cursor's transcript OUT as
conversation items the SPA renders as bubbles) with no live ``cursor-agent`` and
no LLM. ``cursor-agent`` has no OpenAI-compatible / custom-endpoint shim (see
``omnigent.inner.cursor_harness``), so it cannot be pointed at the mock LLM the
custom-agent suites use; instead this test seeds a cursor chat store and runs the
real :func:`omnigent.harnesses.cursor_native.forwarder.forward_cursor_store_to_session`
against the spawned server, so the mirror→server→web path runs on every PR.

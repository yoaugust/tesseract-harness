"""UI journey: spin up two sub-agents, see them in the Agents tab, and
navigate into one and back to the parent.

The user asks the joke director (the session's top-level agent) to get a
joke from each of its two comedian sub-agents. The director's prompt
forbids telling jokes itself; it must `sys_session_send` to `comic_one`
and `comic_two`, which run as two separate child sessions and auto-wake
the director to relay their jokes back into the SPA.

This single journey covers two requested behaviors, kept together so the
heavy multi-agent spin-up (one dispatch turn + two sub-agent turns + the
auto-wake continuation) runs only once:

1. After the relay, the right-rail Agents tab lists BOTH comedians as
   sub-agent rows and its count badge grows past the lone-agent ``1``.
2. Clicking a sub-agent row swaps the chat page to that child's own
   conversation (``/c/<child-id>``), and the header carries a
   "Back to parent session" affordance that returns to the parent.

The load-bearing assertions are the per-run nonces, which exist ONLY in
each comedian's prompt (embedded at registration by the
`joke_subagents_session` fixture): a nonce in the director's bubble can
only have reached it via the real parent -> sub-agent -> inbox -> parent
-> SSE -> UI pipeline, never from a model-invented joke.

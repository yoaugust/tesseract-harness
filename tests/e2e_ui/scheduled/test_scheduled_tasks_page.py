"""UI journey: the Scheduled Tasks page (``/tasks``).

Covers the Scheduled Tasks page row behavior: a task row renders the
human-readable schedule SUMMARY derived client-side from the stored RRULE
(``describeSchedule``), plus a Run-now action and a relative next-run label
("Next run in Xh"). That label is a DELTA formatted from the server's
authoritative ``next_run_at`` (nextRunAt − now) — the client never recomputes
WHICH instant is next (which couldn't match the server anchor for INTERVAL>1
rules), so the old "no client-recomputed countdown" rule still holds. See
``test_scheduled_task_row_run_controls``.

Tasks are seeded through the same REST API the page consumes
(``POST /v1/scheduled-tasks``), so this asserts the real render path
end-to-end. It's LLM-free and fast: no agent turn is dispatched — the
rows are pure UI state derived from the stored rule, so the mock LLM is
never exercised.

    dismiss it again immediately — leaving the minute cells alive just until the
    animation ends, long enough for a visibility check to pass and the click
    after it to miss. Waiting for the exit to finish means the toggle acts on a

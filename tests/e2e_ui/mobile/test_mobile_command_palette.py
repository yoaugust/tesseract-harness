"""E2E: the command palette is a full-screen sheet at a phone viewport.

``CommandPalette.tsx`` renders two layouts off ``useIsMobileViewport()``:
the desktop palette is a centered card anchored at ``top-1/4`` and capped at
``sm:max-w-2xl``; the mobile palette is a top-anchored full-screen sheet sized
to the keyboard-aware visible viewport, so the soft keyboard can't cover the
search field and results. ``CommandPalette.test.tsx`` asserts the class swap in
jsdom, but jsdom does not apply the ``max-md`` media query the hook mirrors, so
it can't prove the real responsive geometry — that is what these tests pin.

Both open the palette with the window-level ⌘/Ctrl+K hotkey (viewport
independent), so neither depends on the mobile drawer's search entry point.
No LLM turn is needed — this is client-side layout + routing.

"""E2E: a pending approval surfaces on the /inbox page and resolves there.

The Inbox page (``web/src/pages/InboxPage.tsx``) gathers every pending
``response.elicitation_request`` across the user's sessions and renders each
as the same ``ApprovalCard`` the chat uses, with a local submit handler that
posts the verdict to the owning session. This test raises a gated-push
approval in a session, navigates to ``/inbox``, asserts the prompt is listed,
approves it from the inbox, and asserts the item drains (the row's pending
count drops to zero, so it falls out of the inbox).

Driven by the same ``approval_session`` fixture as the in-chat card test;
real LLM → nightly + generous timeout.

The second test
(:func:`test_reparked_elicitation_reliably_resurfaces_in_inbox`) covers
omnigent#927: when a hook retry re-parks the *same* elicitation id after the
user already approved it, the inbox card must drop its stale optimistic
verdict and resurface as an actionable pending card — not stay frozen on
"Approved" with no buttons. It drives the real claude-native permission hook
(``POST /v1/sessions/{id}/hooks/permission-request``) so the re-park is a
genuine server round-trip, and repeats the approve→re-park cycle with
randomized timing to walk the 4s websocket rescan window the bug raced
against.

    """A re-parked, already-approved elicitation resurfaces as an actionable card.

    Regression for omnigent#927. When the user approves an inbox approval, the
    page flips it to "Approved" optimistically (``responded`` keyed by
    elicitation id). When a hook retry later re-parks the SAME id (the server
    re-parks after its disconnect/grace window), the session snapshot lists it
    as pending again — but the stale ``responded`` entry pinned the card to
    "Approved" with no buttons, leaving a headless sub-agent invisibly blocked.
    The fix sweeps verdicts whose id is pending again whenever a snapshot
    refresh lands (``dataUpdatedAt`` advances).

    Recreated end to end against the live server: one elicitation id is parked,
    approved in a real browser, then re-parked again and again through the real
    claude-native permission hook (``POST .../hooks/permission-request``) — the
    omnigent#927 shape of a single prompt whose hook keeps re-parking the same
    id. Each retry must bring the card back as a *pending* card
    (``data-state="pending"`` with an Approve button), never a frozen
    "Approved" one. Several retries with randomized delays prove the resurface
    is robust, not a one-off interleaving.

    Timing note: each retry is issued only after the inbox has observed the
    approval drain the count to zero (card gone) plus one ``_WS_RESCAN_S``
    window, so the session-list socket registers the drop before the bump —
    exactly the real flow where the retry arrives seconds later. Issuing it
    inside a single rescan tick is a *separate* coalescing gap (the socket
    never reports the bounce, and the row's ``updated_at`` does not move on a
    re-park) that this fix does not address; this test stays on the path the
    fix governs.

    No real LLM: the hook endpoint parks elicitations directly, which is also
    the only way to deterministically re-park the *same* id (a model-driven
    gate mints a fresh id per call). Nightly + generous timeout to match the

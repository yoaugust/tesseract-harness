r"""E2E: AskUserQuestion renders as a web form (mock, no real Claude Code).

A background thread POSTs directly to the server's
``POST /v1/sessions/{session_id}/hooks/permission-request`` endpoint with an
``AskUserQuestion`` payload. The server parks the elicitation (long-poll), the
SPA renders it as an ``AskUserQuestionForm`` inside an ``ApprovalCard`` — radio
inputs for a single-select question and a Submit button. The test selects an
answer and submits it, confirming the parked HTTP call drains and the verdict
flowed back through the PermissionRequest round-trip.

This approach replaces the original native Claude Code session (real LLM turn)
with a seeded session and a synthetic hook POST — no real Claude Code needed,
test completes in seconds rather than minutes.

This is the structured-form counterpart to the binary approval card
(``test_approval_card.py``): the binary card covers a policy ASK, this covers
Claude's own question tool. It is the sibling of ``test_exit_plan_mode.py``:
both cover a Claude built-in tool that surfaces a structured card rather than
the binary policy ASK.

``test_answered_question_stays_outside_the_worked_fold`` covers the second
half of the story: where the ANSWERED card lands in the transcript once the
turn moves on. ``test_answered_question_survives_a_reload`` covers the third:
the card is rebuilt from the persisted tool call, since the elicitation that
carried it live is never stored.

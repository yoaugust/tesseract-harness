"""Browser e2e: forking from the MIDDLE of a conversation truncates history.

The "Fork from here" per-message action passes that response's id as
``up_to_response_id``, so the server deep-copies the transcript only up to
and including the selected turn. This test drives the real chain — two
marked turns → fork from the FIRST assistant's action → navigate into the
clone — and asserts truncation two independent ways:

1. The rendered fork transcript shows the pre-fork (kept) user turn and
   NOT the post-fork (dropped) one — the DOM proves the server copied a
   truncated item list, not the whole conversation.
2. Asking the clone "what did I ask you" surfaces only the kept code word.
   The SDK harness replays the copied Omnigent transcript as context, so a
   reply that recalls the dropped word would mean the truncation point was
   ignored and the full history leaked into the fork.

Both source and fork run the seeded ``hello_world`` (openai-agents SDK)
agent, so this is fully runnable in the e2e_ui harness (no host / native
CLI needed).

"""Tests for the claude-native client-side launch-state store.

The state module persists per-conversation launch metadata (today
just the cwd a session was created in) under
``~/.omnigent/claude-native/<hash>/launch.json`` so the resume
path can detect cwd mismatches that would otherwise make
``claude --resume`` exit immediately on launch.

The test session's :func:`_isolate_claude_native_state` autouse
fixture (defined in ``tests/conftest.py``) redirects the state
root to a per-session ``tmp_path`` via
:data:`OMNIGENT_CLAUDE_NATIVE_STATE_DIR`, so these tests never
touch the developer's real ``~/.omnigent``.

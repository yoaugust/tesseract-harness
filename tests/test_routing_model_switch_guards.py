"""Static guards on how a routed model reaches a live TUI.

Every check here is a source-level invariant, not a behavior: the behavior is
covered in ``tests/test_claude_native_bridge.py`` (the injector) and
``tests/server/test_turn_routing.py`` (the hook path).

A routed switch is typed as ``/model <id>``. Claude Code answers it with "Set
model to X **and saved as your default for new sessions**" and rewrites the
``model`` key in the person's own ``~/.claude/settings.json`` — an accepted
trade-off, since the alternative (driving the interactive picker over tmux)
cost ~530 lines of fragile screen-scraping automation. What still has to hold
is that Omnigent itself never writes that file, and that the switch path polls
the TUI rather than guessing at its render latency.

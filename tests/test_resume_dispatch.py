Tests for :mod:`omnigent.resume_dispatch` — the top-level
``omnigent resume`` dispatcher.

The dispatcher's job is to translate the user's "take me back to
where I was" intent into the right wrapper call. The two important
properties under test are (a) we always preserve the Omnigent
conversation id end-to-end (no new id minted on resume) and (b)
claude-native conversations route to ``run_claude_native``,
everything else surfaces a clear redirect hint.

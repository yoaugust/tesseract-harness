"""
Unit tests for the native-terminal cost-approval popup script.

Covers :mod:`omnigent.native.native_cost_popup` — the program that runs inside
a ``tmux display-popup`` on a native harness pane, reads an
approve/decline answer, and POSTs the verdict to the Omnigent elicitation-
resolve endpoint (the same endpoint the web ApprovalCard uses).

The tests drive the public :func:`omnigent.native.native_cost_popup.main`
entry point and assert on the exact HTTP request it issues (URL, method,
JSON body) and on the no-request invariant when the popup is dismissed.

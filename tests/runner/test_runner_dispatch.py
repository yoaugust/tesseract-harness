"""End-to-end runner-dispatch tests: server → runner → spawned harness.

The load-bearing assertion: the runner FastAPI app, when given a
real :class:`HarnessProcessManager`, accepts a
POST /v1/sessions/{conversation_id}/events?stream=true,
spawns a harness subprocess (using the existing
``omnigent/runtime/harnesses/`` machinery — NOT a parallel impl),
forwards the request to the harness via UDS, and streams the
harness's SSE response back through the runner's own SSE response.

Architecture verified end-to-end:
- A real ``HarnessProcessManager`` is started (writes its instance
  dir, runs orphan sweep, starts the idle reaper).
- A test-only harness module is registered in ``_HARNESS_MODULES``.
- The runner FastAPI app is built with ``process_manager=mgr``.
- The test posts to the runner's
  /v1/sessions/{conversation_id}/events?stream=true with a message
  body + harness name.
- The runner calls ``mgr.get_client()`` → spawns a uvicorn
  subprocess running the test harness on a UDS → returns the
  per-conversation httpx client.
- The runner POSTs the request to the harness via that client.
- The harness drives an LLM call via ``run_turn`` and streams SSE
  back.
- The runner relays each SSE chunk through to the test client.

The OpenAI-key-gated test runs the full chain against gpt-4o-mini.
The unkeyed test asserts on plumbing only (handler is reached,
503 on bad harness name).

Turn-context recovery tests are also included here (see the
``# ── turn-context recovery ──`` section at the bottom of this
file): verdict-delivery failure retry/signal, ``_resync_turn_state``
edge cases, and the three-factor causal chain.

# same-session send bounce with "already has a launching or running turn",
# leaving cancellation as the only lever. The runner now steers the child's
# in-flight turn instead of refusing, on a path that keeps the turn's SINGLE
# work entry rather than replacing it:
#   * a locally-tracked running/waiting turn reuses its existing entry verbatim
#     (no re-stamp, no re-register), so the one completion always maps to it;
#   * a server-busy-but-untracked turn (e.g. after a runner restart) is adopted
#     by registering one entry directly in "running" (not "launching", so the
#     launch-timeout reaper leaves it alone) with a freshly stamped id.
# On a post failure the child is never torn down: a reused turn stays tracked
# and alive; an adopted registration is rolled back to the prior untracked
# state. Only a child that has not started streaming yet ("launching") is
# deferred with a transient retry. Together these close the completion-race,
# post-failure, and false-reap hazards of a re-stamping continuation (Polly
# review issues #1/#2/#3); the fresh register+stamp continuation path is used
# only for a genuinely idle child.

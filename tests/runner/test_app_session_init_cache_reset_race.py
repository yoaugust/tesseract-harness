"""Session init must not reinstate a spec entry retired by a concurrent reset.

``POST /v1/sessions`` resolves the agent spec early and memoizes it into the
session-keyed spec cache only at the very end of init. An agent-cache reset
landing in between (``POST /v1/sessions/{id}/agent-cache/reset`` — issued by
the server when the user edits the session's agent or its MCP servers) pops
the entry and bumps the session's cache generation; init must not write the
superseded entry back, or every later spec read on the session serves the
pre-reset bundle (instructions, MCP servers, local tools, bundle workdir)
until the next invalidation.

Drives the runner app over real HTTP (ASGI): init is held open inside a slow
agent-spec resolution (the way a slow bundle download holds it open), the
reset is acknowledged mid-init, then a spec-derived read
(``GET /v1/sessions/{id}/skills``) must reflect the post-reset spec.

"""Unit tests for the runner-side ``upload_file`` dispatch containment.

These cover the upload-containment fix: the runner's ``_execute_file_tool``
upload branch must resolve the agent-supplied ``path`` against the
session workspace and reject anything that escapes it, instead of
calling ``open(path, "rb")`` on the raw argument (which let an agent
read arbitrary host files from the un-sandboxed runner process).

The dispatch posts uploaded bytes to the session file store over
HTTP, so we drive it with an ``httpx.MockTransport`` that records
every request. A rejected path must produce an error string AND make
no POST at all (nothing is read or exfiltrated); an in-workspace path
must POST the file's real bytes and return the store's ``file_id``.

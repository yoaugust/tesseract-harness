"""Regression repro: native sub-agent harness must survive a cache refill.

Reproduces the production failure where polly (``claude-sdk``) spawns a
``claude_code`` sub-agent (``claude-native``) and the web UI then shows
*"Bridge closed: terminal resource not found or not running"*.

Root cause (see investigation notes): the child's harness is resolved by
swapping the parent spec to the named sub-agent's sub-spec
(``_find_spec_by_name``). That swap is gated on the in-memory dict
``_session_sub_agent_names``, populated ONLY in ``POST /v1/sessions`` from
``body["sub_agent_name"]``. The streaming dispatch path
(``_stream_message_to_harness`` -> ``_resolve_harness_config``) skips the
swap entirely: it derives the harness from the session's bound ``agent_id``
(the *parent* polly agent) and so resolves ``claude-sdk``. After a tunnel
reconnect / spec-cache eviction (when the in-memory map is empty), a turn
that takes this path asks ``HarnessProcessManager.get_client`` for
``claude-sdk``; the manager sees the harness change
``claude-native -> claude-sdk`` and respawns, tearing down the live
claude-native tmux terminal. The UI's bridge to ``terminal_claude_main``
then fails with the observed error.

The server already persists and returns ``sub_agent_name`` on
``GET /v1/sessions/{id}`` (``SessionResponse.sub_agent_name``); the runner
just drops it. The invariant under test: **a turn dispatched for a
sub-agent session asks the process manager to spawn the CHILD's harness
(``claude-native``) even when the in-memory sub-agent-name map is empty**
(the post-reconnect state), because the identity is recoverable from the
server snapshot.

This test FAILS on the buggy commit (the runner asks for ``claude-sdk``)
and PASSES once the streaming dispatch path is made sub-agent-aware.

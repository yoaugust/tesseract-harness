"""
Runner-owned skill discovery + resolution endpoints.

Skills are resolved on the runner, not the Omnigent server, because the
runner is where the harness executes and may read a skill's local
resource files. These tests exercise the two runner endpoints the AP
server delegates to:

* ``GET /v1/sessions/{id}/skills`` — the merged (bundled + host) skill
  list for the web composer's slash-command menu.
* ``POST /v1/sessions/{id}/skills/resolve`` — a skill invocation's
  hidden ``<skill>`` meta text, with the ``<path>`` resolved against the
  runner's filesystem.

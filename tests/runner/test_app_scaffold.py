"""Tests for the Phase 1 runner scaffold.

Verifies:
- ``create_runner_app`` returns a fresh, mountable FastAPI instance
  every call (the SERVER_HARNESS_CONTRACT.md:609-619 anti-recursion
  rule depends on this).
- ``GET /health`` returns 200 ``{"status": "ok"}`` via the
  ASGI app boundary.
- The stubbed response endpoints return 501 with a structured error
  body (so callers see "not implemented" rather than 404 or a
  surprise 200).

These tests don't validate execution logic; that lands when Phase 1
(full) extracts the tool resolver / MCP / harness lifecycle into
the runner. The scaffold's job is to prove the boundary works.

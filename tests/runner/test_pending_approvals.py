"""Unit tests for :mod:`omnigent.runner.pending_approvals`.

The runner's pending-approvals registry routes policy-ASK verdicts
between two coroutines in the same process: the dispatch path
(which registers a Future and waits on it) and the session-event
handler (which receives the user's verdict and resolves the
Future). Tests here pin the contract directly:

* :func:`register` returns a fresh Future bound to the calling loop.
* :func:`resolve` sets the Future's result and returns whether it
  was delivered (so callers can distinguish "delivered" from
  "no-op").
* :func:`cleanup` is idempotent and pops the entry so unbounded
  growth doesn't accumulate across many ASK round-trips.
* :func:`wait_for_user_approval` is the single sequence every
  ASK-escalation site uses; it must publish
  ``response.elicitation_resolved`` on every exit path so the
  Omnigent server's sidebar index decrements in lockstep.

These invariants drive the cross-session sidebar badge — a
regression in any of them leaves stuck or phantom prompts in the
UI.

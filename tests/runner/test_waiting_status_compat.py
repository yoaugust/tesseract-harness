"""
Unit tests for the runner's session.status "waiting" backwards-compat gate.

The runner emits ``session.status: "waiting"`` (PR #930) only to servers new
enough to serialize it; older servers (< 0.3.0) 500 on ``GET /v1/sessions``, so
the runner downgrades "waiting"→"running" for them. Here we test the pure
version-comparison; the probe + downgrade are exercised end-to-end by
tests/e2e/test_waiting_status_compat_e2e.py (old server + new runner -> no 500).

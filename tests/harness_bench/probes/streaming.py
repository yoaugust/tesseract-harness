"""Streaming probe — token-level deltas vs a single complete blob.

Maps to the matrix's ``deltas`` / ``complete-only`` distinction: more than
one ``response.output_text.delta`` for a multi-token reply means the
harness streams incrementally; a single delta means it forwarded the full
response in one chunk (``PARTIAL`` — "complete-only").

A single measurement is noisy: a harness that streams can occasionally
coalesce a short reply into one delta, which would otherwise read as a
false complete-only and drift against a declared SUPPORTED. So when the
first attempt shows a single delta, the probe retries once and only
concludes complete-only if it reproduces — "streams sometimes" resolves to
SUPPORTED, "never streams" to PARTIAL.

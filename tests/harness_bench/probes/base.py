"""The capability-probe contract.

A probe measures one dimension of the support matrix against one harness.
Probes are harness-agnostic: they call the transport driver's small
surface and return a :class:`ProbeResult`. Adding a dimension means adding
a probe module and listing it in :data:`tests.harness_bench.probes.ALL_PROBES`
— no per-harness code anywhere.

"""Model-override probe — is a caller-specified model honored?

The driver launches the harness with the profile's model in
``{env_prefix}MODEL`` (a non-default id the caller chose). This probe
first checks that model passes Omnigent's override validation and family
gate — the same checks the server applies before spawn — then confirms a
live turn on that model completes, proving the id threaded through to a
real gateway route rather than being dropped.

Limitation (documented for the next iteration): a completed turn proves
the id was *accepted and routable*, not that a different id would have
routed differently. The stronger contrast probe — a family-valid but
nonexistent id must FAIL while the real id SUCCEEDS — is a phase-2
follow-up; it costs a second (deliberately failing) turn and needs the
gateway to reject unknown ids promptly.

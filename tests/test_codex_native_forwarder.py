"""
Tests for the codex-native forwarder's model-change sync-back
(:mod:`omnigent.harnesses.codex_native.forwarder`).

For codex-native, ``config.toml``'s ``model`` key is the cost-policy source
of truth (it is what an in-TUI ``/model`` writes). At subscription and at
each ``turn/started`` the forwarder reads it (``_refresh_model_from_config``,
which delegates to the shared ``read_codex_config_model`` in the bridge
module) onto ``_CodexForwarderState.model`` and mirrors it to the Omnigent server
as an ``external_model_change`` event (→ persisted ``conv.model_override``)
so the cost-budget policy resolves the selected model. The startup/spawn
model IS mirrored (so Omnigent learns the session's model even when unchanged);
only an already-mirrored value is not re-posted.

#
# A failed Codex turn arrives as ``turn/completed`` (a clean success boundary)
# with ``turn.status == "failed"`` and a ``turn.error`` object. These tests pin
# the surface-only fix: such turns are forced to ``failed``, the reason is
# surfaced as the status output, auth errors (codexErrorInfo / 401-403) carry a
# re-auth hint, the resume path reaches the same verdict, an empty turn is idle
# (+ WARN), and a genuinely clean turn still reports success.

"""Unit tests for ``omnigent/model_override.py``.

The validator guards a spawn boundary: a model override is persisted on
the session row and later becomes a ``--model`` argv element (native
CLIs) or a ``HARNESS_<H>_MODEL`` env var (SDK harnesses). These tests
pin the accepted charset, the loud rejections, and the harness-support
map that ``sys_session_send`` consults before forwarding an override.

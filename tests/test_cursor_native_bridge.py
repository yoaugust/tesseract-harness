"""Unit tests for :mod:`omnigent.harnesses.cursor_native.bridge` composer handling.

Focused on the leftover-draft clear (:func:`_clear_composer`) and its use by
:func:`inject_user_message`. cursor-agent restores the interrupted prompt into
the composer when a turn is cancelled (web-UI Stop -> ``inject_interrupt`` sends
``Escape``), and its input widget ignores the readline ``C-a``/``C-k`` keys the
clear used to send — so the leftover survived and prepended the next message.
The clear now floods ``Backspace`` until the pane stops changing.

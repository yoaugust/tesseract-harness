"""
Tests for the MCP proxy ``tools/call`` retry-path policy re-evaluation.

Verifies that a forged retry (caller-supplied ``requestState`` +
``inputResponses``) cannot bypass a DENY or ASK policy gate.  Before
the fix, the retry path trusted these caller-controlled fields as
proof of approval and skipped ``Phase.TOOL_CALL`` evaluation entirely.

The tests call ``_handle_mcp_tools_call`` directly with monkeypatched
dependencies, following the pattern in ``test_sessions_mcp_proxy.py``.

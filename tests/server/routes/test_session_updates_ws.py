"""Tests for the ``WS /v1/sessions/updates`` push stream.

The endpoint replaces the web app's HTTP poll of ``GET /v1/sessions``:
a client sends the session ids it's watching and the server pushes a
``snapshot`` followed by ``changed`` / ``removed`` deltas as those
sessions change. These tests drive the real route (no mocks of the
store or auth) against file-backed SQLite stores, mutating persisted
conversation state to trigger deltas, and assert cross-user isolation.

The per-connection rescan interval is monkeypatched down so the
interval-driven ``changed`` / ``removed`` frames arrive promptly
instead of after the production 4 s cadence.

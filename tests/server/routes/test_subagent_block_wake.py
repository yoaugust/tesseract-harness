"""
Server-side wake delivery for the sub-agent block notifier.

These tests exercise the *server* half of the feature —
:func:`omnigent.server.routes.sessions.configure_subagent_block_notifier`
plus the ``_wake_parent_for_blocked_child`` delivery it wires — driven
through the real
:func:`omnigent.runtime.pending_elicitations.record_publish` chokepoint
(the single point every elicitation publish funnels through). Only the
two boundaries the wake *reuses* are stubbed: ``_get_runner_client``
(runner resolution) and ``_dispatch_session_event_to_runner`` (the
existing, separately-tested forward). What is asserted is purely the new
code: that a child block resolves the parent, formats a ``[System: …]``
message, and delivers it to the parent session — and that it is a no-op
when no runner is bound (so it can never desync store/harness state).

A real :class:`SqlAlchemyConversationStore` is used (no mocked
``get_conversation``) so the parent-resolve path is the production one.

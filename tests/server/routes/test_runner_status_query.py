"""Tests for ``_query_host_runner_status`` — the host-owned liveness query.

The host owns runner-process liveness (it holds the ``Popen``). Before the
message-dispatch connect grace, the server asks the host whether an
absent-from-the-tunnel runner is still coming (``alive``) or gone for good
(``dead`` / ``unknown``). A verdict of ``None`` means "no authoritative
answer" (host too old, slow, or the connection dropped), and the caller
falls back to the plain grace wait — so the query can only ever speed up
the cold path, never slow it down.

"""Guards the ``sessions`` facade re-exports the ``_sessions`` impl package.

The facade (``omnigent.server.routes.sessions``) explicitly re-exports names
from the ``_sessions`` implementation modules. These tests pin cross-module
seams that have bitten us so an omitted export fails at collection time rather
than as a ``NameError`` on a runtime-only branch.

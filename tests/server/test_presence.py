"""Tests for the session presence registry (``omnigent/server/presence.py``).

Broadcasts are observed through a real ``session_stream.subscribe``
collector — the same pub/sub path the SSE route consumes — so every
test exercises the actual publish pipeline, not a mock. Each
``session.presence`` event carries the FULL viewer list (the
protocol's self-healing contract), so assertions compare whole
payloads.

Presence is scoped to a session tree's ROOT conversation: viewers of
the root and of any sub-agent conversation under it share one viewer
list, and broadcasts fan out to every viewed stream in the tree, each
stamped with that stream's own ``conversation_id``. The single-
conversation tests pass the same id for both (a top-level session is
its own root); the sub-agent tests exercise the cross-stream fan-out.

The leave-grace timer is the registry's core flap-protection (the
Databricks Apps ingress drops every stream ~5 minutes, and the grace
window is what keeps avatars from flickering on each reconnect);
tests shrink ``_LEAVE_GRACE_S`` via monkeypatch the same way
``test_session_updates_ws.py`` shrinks its rescan cadence.

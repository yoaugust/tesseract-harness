"""A resolve that lands on a live parked Future must also tombstone the verdict.

A proxy can sever a harness long-poll client-side while holding the backend
connection open: the harness abandons the chunk, but the server never observes
a disconnect, so the chunk's waiter stays registered as a zombie. A resolve
that finds that zombie sets its Future — written to a connection nobody reads —
and, before this fix, wrote NO pre-resolved tombstone (only the nothing-parked
branch did). The harness's next re-park of the same stable id then found
nothing and re-asked the gate; the operator's answer was lost.

These tests pin the resolve-side half of the fix: resolving a live registered
Future ALSO leaves a verdict-carrying tombstone for the same id, so a re-park
can adopt the verdict. The tombstone is session-scoped, TTL-pruned, and
fingerprinted with the answered question's request params, so a LATER,
different question that reuses the same harness id (harness request ids can
recur) can never inherit the stale approval.

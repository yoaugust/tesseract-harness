"""Integration tests for multi-policy composition and precedence.

Verifies the PolicyEngine's composition semantics through the
``POST /v1/sessions/{id}/policies/evaluate`` endpoint:

- DENY takes precedence over ASK on the same phase (engine
  short-circuits on the first DENY).
- Removing a DENY policy lets ASK fire on re-evaluation.
- Two DENY policies: the first in declaration order short-circuits,
  so only its reason is surfaced.
- ALLOW does not override DENY.

Uses ``make_fixed_action_callable`` factories injected via
``default_policies`` monkeypatch so the tests exercise the real
engine composition pipeline end-to-end without depending on the
policy registry allowlist.

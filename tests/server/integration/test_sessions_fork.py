Exercises the fork endpoint through the real route → store → DBOS

# in-process workflow turn (so the source had user+assistant items to
# deep-copy), and the second one also posted a follow-up
# ``/v1/sessions/{id}/events`` to the fork — which now requires a

# cover the fork-specific code paths (route logic, label/title
# inheritance, store-level deep-copy of explicit items, error cases)

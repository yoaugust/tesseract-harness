"""
Tests for the controllable mock tool helper.

These tests verify the queue/blocking/release semantics that
Phase 2+ concurrency tests rely on. If these tests pass, callers
can trust that:

* queued calls are consumed in FIFO order;
* ``call_event`` fires before the body blocks;
* blocked calls don't return until ``release()`` runs;
* exceptions propagate from the call site, not from ``add_call``;
* ``release_all()`` cleans up forgotten releases in teardown.

Without trustworthy mock semantics the broader concurrency suite
becomes fire-and-hope and silently rots. See the testing skill,
"Concurrency test requirements".

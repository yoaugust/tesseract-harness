"""Integration tests for the explicit ``compact`` control event.

The web-UI ``/compact`` command and compact button POST
``{"type": "compact"}`` to ``POST /v1/sessions/{id}/events``. Per
``designs/CLAUDE_NATIVE.md`` ("Control events dispatch on the runner"),
the Omnigent server forwards the control to the bound runner and lets the
runner's harness-specific handler own the operation.

The runner's dispatch contract (verified in
``tests/runner/test_app_sessions_native.py``):

* Native harnesses inject ``/compact`` into the vendor TUI and return
  **200** on success or **5xx** on failure.
* SDK harnesses return **204** (no-op) because their context is controlled
  entirely by the vendor harness; the server surfaces a 400 error.
* A failed injection (pane not attached) returns **503**.

These tests pin the Omnigent side of that contract by stubbing the runner's
HTTP response and asserting the correct server behaviour.

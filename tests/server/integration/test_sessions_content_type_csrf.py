"""
Integration tests for the JSON Content-Type CSRF guard on session POSTs.

Eight session POST handlers parse their body with Starlette's
``await request.json()``, which decodes any body as JSON regardless of
the declared ``Content-Type``. That left them reachable by a cross-site
*simple* request — one carrying ``Content-Type: text/plain`` (so the
browser skips the CORS preflight) whose plain-text payload is actually
valid JSON. The ``require_json_content_type`` /
``require_json_or_multipart_content_type`` dependencies close that gap by
requiring an explicit JSON (or, for the bundled-create route, multipart)
Content-Type before the handler runs.

These tests drive the real routes through the shared ``client`` fixture
(real stores + mock LLM, permissions disabled) and assert:

- a ``text/plain`` body of valid JSON now returns 415 (was accepted),
- a request with no ``Content-Type`` returns 415,
- a correct ``application/json`` request still reaches the handler
  (status is whatever the handler returns — crucially NOT 415),
- ``POST /v1/sessions`` still accepts both JSON and ``multipart/form-data``
  while rejecting ``text/plain``.

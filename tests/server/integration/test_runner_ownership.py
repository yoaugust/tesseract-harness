"""Cross-user tests for runner binding ownership.

Exercises the security invariant that a user can only bind sessions
to runners they own, and that runner listing is scoped to the
caller's own runners.

Uses the ``auth_app`` / ``auth_client`` fixture pattern from
``test_sessions_permissions.py``: a :class:`SqlAlchemyPermissionStore`
is wired into the app so :class:`UnifiedAuthProvider` and permission
checks are active, and ``X-Forwarded-Email`` headers impersonate
different users.

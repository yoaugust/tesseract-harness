"""LIVE drift canary for the keyless DuckDuckGo web_search backend.

The backend parses an uncontrolled third-party HTML page, so its real risk is
silent markup drift (DDG has already dropped the ``/l/?uddg=`` redirect wrapper
once). The offline tests in ``tests/tools/test_web_search_duckduckgo.py`` pin
behavior against a *captured* page; this canary is the only thing that notices
when the *live* page changes shape.

It is deliberately fenced off from normal CI two ways, so it can never red the
PR/push gate:

1. It lives under ``tests/e2e_live/``, which the default ``addopts`` ignores
   (``--ignore=tests/e2e_live`` in pyproject.toml) — unit collection never sees
   it.
2. It is marked ``@pytest.mark.nightly`` — even when the dir is named
   explicitly, PR/push runs pass ``-m "not nightly"`` and skip it; only the
   scheduled / ``workflow_dispatch`` pass runs it.

Run it on demand::

    uv run --group test pytest tests/e2e_live/ -m nightly

A FAIL here means DDG drifted: re-capture the golden fixture with
``tests/tools/fixtures/refresh_ddg_fixture.py`` and fix the parser in
``omnigent/tools/builtins/web_search_duckduckgo.py``. Transient throttling
(429 / 5xx / timeout) SKIPS — it is noise, not drift.

"""Unit tests for deprecated reasoning-effort alias handling.

The ChatGPT desktop app writes ``model_reasoning_effort = "ultra"`` into
``~/.codex/config.toml``; the codex CLI forwards it as the retired ``max``
wire value. Neither is accepted by the OpenAI Responses API anymore, so
``validate_effort`` coerces those aliases to ``xhigh`` — but only for
providers whose supported set doesn't already contain the raw value.

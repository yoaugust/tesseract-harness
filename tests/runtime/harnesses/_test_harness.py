"""
Minimal harness fixture for the process-manager / runner tests.

Exports ``create_app() -> FastAPI`` matching the contract from
``designs/SERVER_HARNESS_CONTRACT.md`` §Required harness package
shape, so the runner can import + serve it the same way it would
serve a real harness wrap.

The app implements just enough surface for the lifecycle tests to
verify spawn / health / round-trip behavior:

- ``GET /health`` returns ``{"status": "ok"}`` (the standard probe).
- ``GET /pid`` returns the runner subprocess's pid — useful for
  tests that need to verify the same subprocess persists across
  multiple ``get_client`` calls.
- ``GET /conversation-id`` returns the value the runner stashed
  on ``app.state.conversation_id`` — verifies the
  ``--conversation-id`` plumbing in the runner.
- ``GET /env/{name}`` returns the subprocess's value for the
  given env var (or ``null``). Used by per-spawn-env tests to
  verify ``HarnessProcessManager.get_client(env=...)`` actually
  threads through to the spawned process.
- ``GET /slow-stream`` emits a chunk every 0.5s for ``count``
  seconds. Used by the reaper-mid-stream regression test to
  hold a streaming response open across reaper passes and
  verify the active stream isn't torn down by an over-eager
  ``last_used_at`` cutoff.
- ``GET /stuck-shutdown`` returns immediately but its background
  task ignores cancellation forever. Used to verify a plain
  SIGTERM has a hard-exit backstop even if graceful shutdown
  wedges before lifespan teardown completes.
- ``POST /v1/sessions/{conversation_id}/events`` accepts
  interrupt events. Used by cancel-forwarding tests.

Lives under ``tests/`` so it doesn't ship as production code; the
test process registers the module path
(``"tests.runtime.harnesses._test_harness"``) in
:data:`omnigent.runtime.harnesses._HARNESS_MODULES` per test.

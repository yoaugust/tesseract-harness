"""
Tests for the policy evaluation round-trip added to
:class:`TurnContext` and :class:`HarnessApp` in the scaffold.

Verifies:

- ``TurnContext.evaluate_policy`` parks on a Future and emits
  a ``PolicyEvaluationRequestEvent`` SSE event upstream.
- ``PolicyVerdictEvent`` inbound events resolve the parked Future
  with the correct :class:`PolicyVerdictPayload`.
- ``_cancel_pending`` cancels outstanding policy evaluation Futures.
- Stale ``evaluation_id`` on a verdict event silently no-ops.

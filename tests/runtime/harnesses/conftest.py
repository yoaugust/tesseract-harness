"""
Conftest for the harness process-manager / runner tests.

Ensures the runner subprocesses these tests spawn can import both
the production ``omnigent`` package AND the test fixture harness
at ``tests.runtime.harnesses._test_harness``.

pytest's :data:`pyproject.toml` ``pythonpath = ["."]`` adds the
project root to ``sys.path`` of the test process — but
:func:`asyncio.create_subprocess_exec` only inherits the OS env
(``PYTHONPATH``), not the parent's ``sys.path`` mutations. Without
this fixture the runner subprocess starts with no project root on
its path and fails to import either ``omnigent.runtime.harnesses._runner``
or the test harness module.

The fixture is autouse-scoped to this directory, so every spawn
in these tests inherits a PYTHONPATH that includes the project
root. Setting it via :func:`monkeypatch.setenv` keeps the
modification scoped to one test — other test modules that don't
care about PYTHONPATH are unaffected.

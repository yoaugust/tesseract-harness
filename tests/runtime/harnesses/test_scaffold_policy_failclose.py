"""Regression for phase-aware policy-evaluation timeout.

NON-EDIT guard: the scaffold's ``TurnContext.evaluate_policy``
timeout default must stay phase-aware — on expiry, ``PHASE_TOOL_CALL`` fails
CLOSED (DENY) because it is the authoritative gate for connector-native MCP
tools, while advisory LLM phases and ``PHASE_TOOL_RESULT`` (the tool already
ran) fail OPEN (ALLOW). This test forces the timeout (no verdict ever
delivered) and asserts the defaults, so a future change to the constant or
the fallback can't silently flip a tool-call gate open.

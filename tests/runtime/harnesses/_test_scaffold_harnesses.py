HarnessApp subclass fixtures for scaffold tests.

Each fixture exercises one slice of the scaffold contract — echo,
tool dispatch, elicitation, cancellation, injection. They share
the convention that ``create_app`` in this module reads an
environment variable (``HARNESS_TEST_FIXTURE``) to pick which
subclass to instantiate so the tests can register a single
module path in ``_HARNESS_MODULES`` and parametrize the fixture
selection per test.

Lives under ``tests/`` so it doesn't ship as production code.

"""
End-to-end policy scenarios loaded directly from the
omnigent-format example YAMLs under ``examples/*.yaml``.

Complements :mod:`test_enforcement_integration`, which loads
pre-translated omnigent-native fixtures. The fixtures there
are hand-maintained ports; any bug in the omnigent → omnigent
adapter layer (e.g. ``condition: {}`` parse rejection,
``match_tools`` → ``on:`` expansion) slips past those tests. This module goes through
:func:`omnigent.spec.load` — the same path ``omnigent run``
uses — so the adapter is exercised on every run.

Scenarios mirror the user-documented trigger matrix:

#. ``agent_with_policies.yaml`` — sleep ≤ 5s → ALLOW.
#. ``agent_with_policies.yaml`` — sleep > 5s → DENY.
   **Documented pre-existing gap**: the example uses a legacy
   2-arg ``(content, phase)`` callable signature. Agent-plane's
   :class:`FunctionPolicy` calls 2-arg callables as
   ``(ctx, context)``, which doesn't match. The callable's
   ``isinstance(content, dict)`` guard falls through and the
   policy returns ALLOW. Marked xfail so the regression is
   visible if/when the signature adapter is added.
#. ``rate_limited_search_agent.yaml`` — first web_search → ALLOW.
#. ``rate_limited_search_agent.yaml`` — 4th web_search → ASK.
   Same legacy-signature gap as #2 (xfail).
#. ``secure_research_agent.yaml`` — clean run_shell → ALLOW.
#. ``secure_research_agent.yaml`` — read → run_shell → ASK
   (ask_high_confidentiality).
#. ``secure_research_agent.yaml`` — web_search + read →
   run_shell → DENY (deny_contaminated_shell).
#. ``secure_research_agent_os_env.yaml`` — same flow as #7,
   verifies the os_env variant's policy block still fires.

Prompt-policy scenarios (``block_canada_input``,
``block_canada_output``) require the real-LLM classifier and
are covered by :mod:`tests.e2e.test_policies_e2e`
(``test_prompt_policy_*``) — not re-tested here.

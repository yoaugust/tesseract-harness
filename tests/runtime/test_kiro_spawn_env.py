"""Unit tests for the kiro-native spawn-env / terminal-env builders.

The kiro-native harness is terminal-first: the runner spawns ``kiro-cli`` in a
tmux pane and the executor reads ``HARNESS_KIRO_NATIVE_BRIDGE_DIR`` to find the
per-session bridge directory. Two builders in ``omnigent.harnesses.kiro_native.bridge``
produce that env:

* :func:`build_kiro_native_spawn_env` — the minimal env handed to the harness
  executor: *only* the bridge-dir pointer (kiro has no provider/model/theme env,
  unlike goose-native's ``build_goose_native_spawn_env``).
* :func:`build_kiro_native_terminal_env` — the allowlisted child env for the
  ``kiro-cli`` process itself: the bridge-dir pointer and the ACP-record path,
  plus a fixed allowlist of terminal/locale vars, with everything else (ambient
  provider keys, arbitrary exports) dropped.

This is the kiro sibling of ``tests/runtime/test_goose_spawn_env.py``. Like that
suite it does not isolate ``TMPDIR`` — ``_BRIDGE_ROOT`` is resolved at import
time, so the builders write their per-session dir under the real
``/tmp/omnigent-<uid>/kiro-native/`` and the assertions key off the path shape,
determinism, and permissions rather than an injected root.

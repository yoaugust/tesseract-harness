Unit tests for :mod:`omnigent.runtime.session_stream`.

The session stream is a pure pub-sub fan-out:

* :func:`publish` is a no-op when no subscriber is connected for the
  conversation_id.
* Every active :func:`subscribe` call gets its own queue and sees
  every event published after it subscribed.
* :func:`close` broadcasts an end-of-stream sentinel to every
  subscriber.
* Subscriber slots are torn down in the generator's ``finally``
  block so leaks cannot accumulate.

These tests pin those invariants directly. They are sibling to the
workflow-integration drift tests in
:mod:`tests.server.test_stream_events`, which exercise the
end-to-end publish pipeline.

    """
    A delta streamed in the ready_event gap renders once, not twice.

    Reproduces the real ``/stream`` subscribe shape and the double-render
    regression. The route passes BOTH ``ready_event`` (the subscription
    ack heartbeat, yielded first — which SUSPENDS the generator) and
    ``pre_ready_snapshot`` (the in-flight text replay). The relay
    keeps publishing deltas during the post-``ready_event`` gap. The fix
    captures the replay snapshot synchronously at slot registration —
    before the suspension — so a gap delta lands ONLY on the live tail,
    not in both the replay and the tail.

    1. A turn streams ``response.created`` + two deltas with NO
       subscriber connected — lost to the live stream (no replay
       buffer), recoverable only from the in-flight index.
    2. A client subscribes with ``ready_event`` + ``pre_ready_snapshot``,
       exactly as the route does.
    3. After the ack arrives, the relay publishes one more delta ("!")
       in the gap. The slot is registered, so it joins the live tail;
       the snapshot was already frozen at registration without it.
    4. The bubble renders the recovered prefix once + the gap delta once.

    Breakage that turns this red: moving the snapshot read back behind
    ``yield ready_event`` (into the async ``on_subscribed`` hook). Then
    "!" is in BOTH the replayed snapshot text AND the live tail, and the
    bubble renders "Hello world!!" instead of "Hello world!".

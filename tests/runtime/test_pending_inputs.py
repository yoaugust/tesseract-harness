"""
Unit tests for :mod:`omnigent.runtime.pending_inputs`.

The pending-inputs index holds web-composer user messages on
native-terminal sessions that haven't yet round-tripped back through
the transcript forwarder. It backs the optimistic "queued message"
bubble across a client re-bind by replaying un-consumed messages into
the session snapshot. Tests here pin its core invariants directly:

* :func:`record` assigns a unique id and :func:`snapshot_for` replays
  entries in FIFO (insertion) order with their content verbatim.
* :func:`resolve_oldest` drains the oldest entry (FIFO) and returns its
  id, regardless of the persisted message's text — the transcript
  reformats text (reply quotes, attachment markers), so order is the
  only reliable correlation signal. Returns ``None`` when empty.
* :func:`resolve` removes an entry by id (the forward-failed rollback
  path) and is idempotent.
* Stale entries are evicted after :data:`pending_inputs._TTL_S` — the
  ghost-cleanup backstop for a message the TUI never accepted.

The wire-up between the route layer and the index (record on POST,
drain at persist, replay in the snapshot) is covered by the server
route tests; this file tests the module in isolation.

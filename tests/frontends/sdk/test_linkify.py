"""
Tests for the OSC 8 URL-linkification helper used by
:class:`omnigent_ui_sdk.terminal.TerminalHost`.

Covers:

- bare URLs in plain text get wrapped
- already-linkified content is preserved verbatim (idempotent)
- trailing punctuation is excluded from the link region
- URLs inside parentheses / quotes / angle brackets terminate
  cleanly before the delimiter
- composes with surrounding ANSI SGR styling (Rich-rendered
  content is the typical input)
- empty / no-URL strings pass through unchanged

Why this gets a focused unit test rather than only being
covered by the higher-level ``TerminalHost`` tests: the regex
and the trailing-punctuation peel are subtle, and a regression
silently downgrades clickable-URL rendering for every agent
that emits links. A dedicated test file makes the contract
unambiguous and catches a subtle regex break in one shot.

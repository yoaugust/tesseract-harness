"""
Minimal TerminalHost driver for the overlay auto-refresh
regression test (:mod:`tests.frontends.sdk.test_overlay_refresh`).

Boots a :class:`TerminalHost` with a single overlay target whose
builder returns content that changes every invocation. This lets
the test verify that the SDK's 500 ms periodic refresh loop picks
up content changes without any user action — the exact mechanic
that keeps the debug pane live while a turn streams server-side.

The shared ``_TICK_COUNTER`` increments each builder call so the
rendered text is always distinct, and the test asserts that the
second tick's sentinel appears on-screen within the refresh
budget.

Run directly with ``python _overlay_refresh_driver.py`` — the
main loop blocks until Ctrl+D / Ctrl+C.

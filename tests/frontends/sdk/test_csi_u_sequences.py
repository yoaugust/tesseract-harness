"""
Unit tests for the Kitty Keyboard Protocol (CSI-u) escape
sequence registration in
:mod:`omnigent_ui_sdk.terminal._host`.

The host installs a set of ``\\x1b[<cp>;<modifier>u`` →
:class:`prompt_toolkit.keys.Keys` translations at construction
time so terminals running CSI-u (Kitty, WezTerm, Ghostty,
iTerm2 with the option enabled, modern xterm) see their
``Ctrl+letter`` / ``Shift+Enter`` keystrokes recognized
instead of silently dropped. Without the install, prompt-
toolkit's vt100 parser doesn't know about CSI-u and those
keys never fire any binding.

These tests pin two contracts:

1. The expected sequences land in
   ``prompt_toolkit.input.vt100_parser.ANSI_SEQUENCES`` after
   :class:`TerminalHost` construction.
2. The install is idempotent — multiple host constructions in
   the same process don't error or re-mutate the parser dict
   redundantly.

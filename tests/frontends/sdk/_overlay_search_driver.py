"""
Minimal TerminalHost driver for the overlay ``/`` search test
(:mod:`tests.frontends.sdk.test_overlay_search`).

Boots a :class:`TerminalHost` with a single overlay whose
builder returns a long, structured block of lines — enough that
the test can press ``/`` + a distinctive needle and assert the
content pane scrolled to the matching line.

Run directly with ``python _overlay_search_driver.py`` — the
main loop blocks until Ctrl+D / Ctrl+C.

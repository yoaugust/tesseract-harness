"""
PTY regression test: the REPL host must produce both rendered
markdown AND no duplicate visible text, even when the streamed
response is taller than the terminal viewport.

The bug (user-reported on 2026-04-28): a long markdown response
under ``claude-sdk`` rendered TWICE — first as raw streamed
text with literal ``**`` markers, then again as rendered markdown
below it. Items 1-6 of a 17-item list appeared raw at top, then the
rendered markdown for items 1-17 appeared below.

Root cause: each growing live render (``StreamLive``) and the final
``StreamReplace`` are drawn by ``_replace_live_region``, which clears
the previous region with a cursor-up + erase repeated
``_live_line_count + _streamed_line_count`` times. Cursor-up movements
past row 0 of the viewport are no-ops — so once a live render grew
taller than the viewport, its top lines scrolled into scrollback and
the next clear could no longer reach them. The visible viewport got
cleared and the markdown rendered below, but scrolled-off content
remained in scrollback — visible duplication wherever scrollback can
be observed (terminal scroll, ``script(1)``, ``tmux`` capture-pane,
screenshots with buffered context).

Fix: in ``_replace_live_region``'s non-commit (``StreamLive``) path,
cap the rendered live region to the viewport ceiling
(``_term_height() - _BOTTOM_RESERVED_ROWS``), keeping only the last
``ceiling + 1`` lines. Because the live region never exceeds what
cursor-up can reach, every subsequent clear (including the final
committed ``StreamReplace``) erases the whole region before the
markdown renders. Markdown formatting is preserved end-to-end;
duplication never appears.

Trade-off vs. UX: long responses show only the tail of the live render
once they fill the viewport (the full text arrives with the committed
markdown panel). Short responses render live in full as before.

This test forks the host's output path under a PTY with a TIGHT
viewport (15 rows), produces 30 numbered markdown items, captures the
byte stream, and re-plays through ``pyte.HistoryScreen`` so both the
visible viewport AND the scrollback are inspectable. Asserts: every
item appears exactly once across visible + scrollback, AND no ``**``
raw markdown markers survive (proving the markdown render took over).

Determinism: the driver (``_overflow_render_driver.py``) calls
``TerminalHost.output`` synchronously — it does NOT run the interactive
prompt-toolkit application. ``output`` writes the streamed renders and
the final ``StreamReplace`` via plain ``print`` / ``sys.stdout.write``,
all in order; the overflow guard under test lives entirely in that
synchronous path. The earlier version ran the live app and relied on
fixed ``asyncio.sleep`` delays, but the app's pinned prompt + toolbar
redraw on a ~10fps timer shared the PTY and interleaved cursor moves
between the driver's prints, corrupting the capture — the test flaked
on CI (duplication detected) with no product regression. Driving
``output`` directly removes that concurrent writer while exercising the
exact same guard.

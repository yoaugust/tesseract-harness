"""
Minimal TerminalHost driver for the overlay Tab-refresh regression
test (:mod:`tests.frontends.sdk.test_overlay_tab_refresh`).

Boots a :class:`TerminalHost` with two static overlay targets —
``main`` and ``sub:test`` — whose content is a unique sentinel
string per target. The test script uses pexpect to press Ctrl+O
to open the overlay, then Tab to cycle, then asserts the sub
target's sentinel appears without any follow-up keystroke. This
driver is intentionally minimal: no server, no LLM, no real
content fetch, so the test hits the SDK's keybinding + invalidate
logic in isolation.

Run directly with ``python _overlay_tab_driver.py`` — the main
loop blocks until Ctrl+D / Ctrl+C.

    Return a per-target sentinel string with a forced async delay.

    The 200 ms sleep is critical to the regression test. In
    production, ``_build_content`` awaits an HTTP GET against the
    conversations endpoint — so by the time the builder returns,
    the Tab keypress has already triggered a prompt-toolkit
    render, and that render captured the OLD content pane. After
    the builder completes, prompt-toolkit has no idea new content
    is available unless ``app.invalidate()`` is called.

    Without the sleep, the builder is synchronous-fast — the
    coroutine completes before the keypress-triggered render even
    happens, so ``_get_visible_ansi`` reads the fresh content
    during that first render and the test passes *even without
    the invalidate() fix*, hiding the bug.

    :param target: The currently-selected overlay target. ``None``
        only happens when ``targets_builder`` returns empty, which
        this driver never does — but handle it anyway so a stale
        sidebar build doesn't crash the overlay mid-test.
    :returns: Plain text (no Rich markup) so the overlay's content
        pane renders the sentinel literally and the test can match
        on it cleanly via pyte.

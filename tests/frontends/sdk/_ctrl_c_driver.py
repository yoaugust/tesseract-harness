"""
Minimal TerminalHost driver for the two-press Ctrl+C exit test
(:mod:`tests.frontends.sdk.test_ctrl_c`).

Boots a :class:`TerminalHost` with a no-op input handler and
prints a sentinel to stdout when the host's ``run`` loop exits
cleanly (the only way the loop returns in this driver is via
:class:`KeyboardInterrupt` — i.e. the second Ctrl+C within the
confirm window).

Run directly with ``python _ctrl_c_driver.py`` — the main loop
runs until Ctrl+C-Ctrl+C or EOF.

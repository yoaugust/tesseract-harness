"""
SDK SSE-parser coverage for the async-dispatch protocol.

Two parser surfaces this file pins:

1. ``response.client_task.cancel`` — the server emits this when an
   in-flight ``kind="client_tool"`` task is cancelled (direct or
   via parent-cancel propagation). The SDK must surface a typed
   :class:`ClientTaskCancel` event so consumers can cancel their
   local asyncio task; otherwise the cancelled tool body keeps
   running and wastes compute.
2. The function_call → function_call_output handshake under
   async dispatch — the LLM dispatches a tool, the server emits
   the ``_AsyncToolHandle`` JSON inline as the FCO output, and
   downstream consumers parse it to extract ``task_id``. The
   parser additions for the async-dispatch protocol must not
   regress that path.

Historical note: this file used to also pin the SDK's
``build_tool_handler`` schema-injection behavior for
``@tool(synchronous=False)`` — that decorator was removed once
``sys_call_async`` shipped (step 11 of the harness contract), and
the corresponding SDK schema injection went with it. The remaining
SSE parser coverage stays here because no other test file owns it.

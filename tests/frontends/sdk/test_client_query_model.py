"""Unit test: ``OmnigentClient.query(..., model_override=...)`` threads to Session.

Mirrors :mod:`tests.frontends.sdk.test_client_query_reasoning`. Confirms
that the public one-shot SDK surface (``client.query``) honors the
``model_override`` parameter by calling
:meth:`Session.set_model_override` on the temporary session it
constructs internally — same pattern Corey's effort PR used for the
``reasoning`` kwarg.

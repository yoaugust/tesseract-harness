"""Rate-limiting policy for the local ``search_web`` tool: 3 free, then ASK.

This is a stateful FunctionPolicy callable.  It uses module-level state
(a dict keyed by session id would be needed for multi-session, but this
simple version uses a plain counter suitable for a single session).

The callable follows the Service Policies V0 contract:
``fn(event) -> {"result": ..., "reason": ...}``.

Gates on the agent-facing tool name ``search_web`` rather than
``web_search`` because the latter is a reserved Omnigent built-in (see
``omnigent/tools/builtins/__init__.py:BUILTIN_NAMES``); the example
YAML names its local search tool ``search_web`` to avoid the
collision.

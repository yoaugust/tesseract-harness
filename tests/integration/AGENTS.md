# tests/integration/ — per-harness journey suite

Real-server, real-LLM journeys run once per wrapped harness. These
replace the per-harness signal lost when `tests/inner/test_integration.py`
was deleted with the legacy in-process runtime (PR #1800), but they
exercise the production server/runner path, not the legacy one.

Not to be confused with `tests/server/integration/`, which is the
mock-LLM server integration suite that runs in the default CI matrix.

## How it runs

- Excluded from the default `pytest` run (`--ignore=tests/integration`
  in pyproject.toml) and additionally gated on `--integration`.
- One harness per invocation, selected by `--harness` (no default;
  must be one of `claude-sdk`, `codex`, `openai-agents`), model pinned
  by `--model`.
- CI: one nightly.yml matrix leg per harness; `claude-sdk-debug.yml`
  for focused claude-sdk iteration with `-k`.

Local examples (the harness CLI must be installed for claude-sdk /
codex; missing CLIs skip with a clear reason):

```bash
pytest tests/integration/ --integration --profile <name> --llm-api-key $KEY \
    --harness claude-sdk --model databricks-claude-sonnet-4-6 -v

pytest tests/integration/ --integration --profile <name> --llm-api-key $KEY \
    --harness openai-agents --model databricks-gpt-5-4-mini -v

pytest tests/integration/ --integration --profile <name> --llm-api-key $KEY \
    --harness codex --model databricks-gpt-5-5 -v
```

## Journeys

| File | Invariant |
|---|---|
| `test_smoke.py` | Single-turn marker echo (basic harness liveness) |
| `test_multi_turn.py` | Three-turn context retention across dispatches |
| `test_client_tools.py` | Tunneled client-tool results thread into the next turn's context |
| `test_sharing.py` | An EDIT collaborator's turn sees the owner's context and completes |

One journey per file on purpose: `--dist=loadscope` groups by module,
so separate files parallelize across xdist workers (each worker gets
its own session-scoped live server, same as `tests/e2e/`).

## Authoring rules

- Keep every test under the CI per-test `--timeout=180` cap (turn
  polls are capped at 50s for this reason). Do not add `llm_flaky`
  or `flaky` markers.
- Prompts must be imperative and assertions must check literal
  markers (`uuid` hex), never just "some text came back".
- New harness? Add a nightly.yml matrix leg and extend
  `_SUPPORTED_HARNESSES` in `conftest.py`.

## Mock-LLM mode

All tests run against the always-on mock LLM server (no real gateway
credentials required). The `--integration` gate is lifted when no
`--llm-api-key` is passed (`conftest.py::pytest_collection_modifyitems`).

One rule to keep queues clean:

- **Central queue reset** — `conftest.py` has an autouse,
  function-scoped `_reset_mock_llm_between_tests` fixture that clears the
  shared (session-scoped) mock server queues before and after every
  test. The mock server falls back to a default response when a queue is
  exhausted or keyed for another agent, so without this reset a scripted
  test leaks responses into its siblings. Do NOT add a per-file reset
  fixture — the central one covers the whole directory.

"""Client-side tool result threading across turns.

Turn 1 forces a tunneled client-tool call, posts a marker payload as
the result, and the model must surface it. Turn 2 asks for the value
with no tool attached: the answer can only come from the turn-1
transcript, so this fails if tool outputs don't thread into the next
dispatch's context on the harness under test.

Turn 1 is driven over ``GET /v1/sessions/{id}/stream``: on the harness
path, ``action_required`` function_calls are published to the live
stream only and never persisted as conversation items (see
``tests/e2e/test_openai_coder_client_tools.py``), so snapshot polling
would hang waiting for an item that never appears.

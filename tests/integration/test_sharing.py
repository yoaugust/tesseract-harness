"""Cross-user sharing on the harness under test.

The runner-owning ``local`` identity owns a session, establishes
context, and grants Bob EDIT; Bob's follow-up turn must see the
owner's context AND complete under Bob's identity. (The owner must be
``local``: the runner-ownership rule forbids binding a session to
another user's runner, and the fixture runner is registered
headerless.) HTTP-level permission semantics live in
``tests/e2e/test_sharing_permissions_e2e.py``; this journey pins the
per-harness behavior of a shared multi-user conversation.

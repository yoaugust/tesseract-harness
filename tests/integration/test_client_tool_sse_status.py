"""Mock-LLM integration coverage for the client-side tool SSE-status
and dispatch-routing invariants.

Re-homes two suppressed ``/v1/responses`` e2e tests (the route was
removed) at the mock-LLM sessions-API layer, the same path
:mod:`tests.integration.test_d6_async_cancel_round_trip` and
:mod:`tests.integration.test_client_tools` prove works in mock mode:

1. ``test_client_side_tool_inline_sse_carries_action_required`` —
   re-homes ``tests/e2e/test_client_tool_sse_status_e2e.py``. A
   request-supplied (client-side) tool call surfaces on the live
   stream's ``response.output_item.done`` event with
   ``status="action_required"`` — the ``ToolCallInProgress.is_client_side``
   plumbing the original e2e pinned. After the test posts the
   ``function_call_output`` (the sessions-API replacement for the
   removed ``PATCH /v1/responses`` ``tool_results``), the sentinel
   round-trips into the text deltas and the turn completes cleanly.

2. ``test_request_supplied_client_tool_result_reaches_model`` —
   re-homes ``tests/e2e/test_tool_dispatch_workflow_client_side_e2e.py``.
   A request-supplied client-side tool routes through the
   client-side dispatch branch (not the ``unknown server-side tool``
   error envelope): the posted sentinel reaches the model verbatim
   in the final answer. Same client-tool round-trip the dispatch
   workflow's ``_is_parent_client_side_tool`` branch must serve.

The mock LLM is scripted with a fixed tool-call sequence, so the
agent prompt is irrelevant — the queued responses drive the turn.

Runs in the default suite in mock mode (no ``--llm-api-key``); the
``tests/integration`` package gate is lifted in mock mode by
``tests/integration/conftest.py``.

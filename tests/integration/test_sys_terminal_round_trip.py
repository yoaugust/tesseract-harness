"""Mock-LLM sessions coverage for re-homed sequential ``sys_terminal_*`` e2e.

Re-homes three suppressed e2e tests that lived in
``tests/e2e/test_sys_terminal_e2e.py`` and only stayed red because they
drove the **removed** ``POST /v1/responses`` route (plus
``poll_until_terminal``'s ``GET /v1/responses/{id}``). That route no
longer exists under ``omnigent/server/routes/``; the cited
"500 / runner availability" reason on issue 532 was a stale
misdiagnosis. These replacements drive the current runner-bound
sessions API in mock-LLM mode instead — the same path the merged D6
re-homes (``test_d6_async_cancel_round_trip``,
``test_d6_parallel_fan_out_round_trip``) use.

Why this faithfully exercises the same surface
-----------------------------------------------
``sys_terminal_*`` are AP-side / server-executed tools (the runner's
tool dispatcher runs ``TerminalRegistry`` → real tmux and threads the
result back to the model), NOT client-side ``action_required`` tools.
So a mock LLM scripted to emit ``sys_terminal_launch`` / ``send`` /
``read`` / ``list`` / ``close`` calls actually drives real tmux on the
server — no external client has to fulfill anything. The agent loop
consumes exactly one queued mock response per model call, so a single
user turn with a queue of ``[launch, send, read, ..., final_text]``
executes the steps in strict sequential order (each tool result is
posted back before the next queued response is consumed). That gives
the same launch→send→read→list→close ordering the old real-LLM e2e
relied on, without trusting an LLM to follow a prompt.

Harness choice
--------------
Runs on the ``openai-agents`` harness — the default in mock mode (see
``tests/integration/conftest.py::harness_name``). The mock LLM speaks
the OpenAI ``/v1/responses`` SSE shape that harness consumes. Terminal
tool execution is harness-agnostic (it is a runner-side registry
lookup + tmux spawn), so the on-disk ``sys-terminal-test`` claude-sdk
agent is not usable in mock mode; instead each test registers a minimal
inline ``openai-agents`` agent carrying the same ``terminals:`` block
via ``register_inline_agent(extra_config=...)``. This mirrors
``test_d6_parallel_fan_out_round_trip.py::terminal_mock_agent``.

Coverage deltas vs. the old e2e (honest notes)
----------------------------------------------
* The old tests proved a *real LLM* chose to call the tools from a
  natural-language prompt. The mock layer scripts the calls, so it does
  NOT prove prompt-following / tool-selection — only that the
  server-executed terminal plumbing round-trips correctly. The
  registration→dispatch→tmux→result path, the load-bearing behavior, is
  exercised identically.
* Markers are produced by the shell itself (``echo`` output captured by
  ``sys_terminal_read``), so a passing assertion still proves data flowed
  send→tmux→read, exactly as before.

Runs in mock mode (no ``--llm-api-key``); the ``tests/integration``
package gate is lifted in mock mode by
``tests/integration/conftest.py``. Skipped when tmux is not installed.

    Re-homes ``test_sys_terminal_send_keys_drives_interactive_e2e`` —
    the load-bearing capability ``sys_terminal_*`` adds over a one-shot
    ``sys_os_shell``: a process that stays alive across two separate
    ``send`` calls, with the second send interpreted by the live process
    from the first. The script:

    1. launch bash:pyrepl,
    2. send ``python3`` + Enter (start the REPL),
    3. send ``print(2+2)`` + Enter (the second send the REPL must
       interpret),
    4. read (x3 for timing resilience — see below).

    Asserts ``>= 2`` sends fired (a single merged send would not prove
    interactive driving) and that ``4`` — the REPL's evaluation of the
    *second* send — appears in a read capture. The two sends crossing
    Enter-key handling and the REPL surviving between them is what
    distinguishes this from a stateless shell command.

    Honest coverage delta vs. the old e2e: identical load-bearing
    assertions (``>=2`` sends + ``4`` in the pane). The only difference
    is the calls are scripted rather than chosen by a real LLM, so this
    does not prove a model would *decide* to drive the REPL with two
    sends — only that the server-side send/Enter/REPL plumbing works
    when it does. Mock ``delay`` pauses before the second send and each
    read give the cold ``python3`` interpreter real wall-clock time to
    boot and evaluate before capture; the old e2e leaned on real-LLM
    "wait briefly" pauses for the same reason, and back-to-back mock
    responses on a loaded CI runner reintroduced the race the delays fix.

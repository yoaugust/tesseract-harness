"""Tests for the conversation-search trigram indexes migration.

Session search (``GET /v1/sessions?search_query=``) matches on
``LOWER(title) LIKE '%q%'`` OR ``LOWER(search_text) LIKE '%q%'``. The leading
wildcard makes both unindexable by a b-tree, so on Postgres the content half
sequential-scans every ``conversation_items`` row. Migration ``d5e9f1a2b3c4``
adds ``pg_trgm`` GIN indexes on those two lowercased expressions so the existing
``LIKE`` becomes index-backed (Postgres only; a no-op on SQLite, which keeps its
FTS5 table and small dev tables).

These tests assert the post-migration shape per dialect and that the chain stays
reversible. The Postgres leg (marked ``databricks``) additionally proves the
planner uses the content index for the real search predicate.

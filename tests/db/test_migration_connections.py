"""Tests for the connections migration (ga1b2c3d4e5f).

The single-head test is the guard: a stacked PR whose migration chains off a
revision that isn't a real ancestor leaves the tree with two heads, and
``alembic upgrade head`` — which runs on every server boot and every DB-touching
test — then raises. Asserting a single head catches that before CI does.

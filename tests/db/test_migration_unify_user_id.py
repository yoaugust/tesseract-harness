"""Tests for the user_id-unification migration (b3c1a2d4e5f6).

Verifies that after upgrade the session-owner identity columns match the
schema-wide ``user_id`` convention: ``hosts.owner`` is now ``hosts.user_id``
(``VARCHAR(128)``) behind ``uq_hosts_workspace_user_id_name``, and
``scheduled_tasks.owner_user_id`` is now ``scheduled_tasks.user_id`` behind
``ix_scheduled_tasks_user_id``. Downgrade restores the original ``owner`` /
``owner_user_id`` names (and their constraint/index names) with row data intact.

"""Tests for the ``comments.updated_at`` migration (``ecc0e25727b0``).

The column feeds the per-session comments change fingerprint surfaced on
``GET /v1/sessions`` / ``WS /v1/sessions/updates``. Existing rows must
backfill to ``created_at`` scaled to microseconds (a never-edited
comment's last mutation time is its creation time; ``updated_at`` is
stored in epoch-µs) and the column must end up NOT NULL to match the
ORM model.

"""E2E: transient network blips during MCP tool calls must be retried.

Guards the regression where the MCP tool-call retry path treats transient
network failures (connection reset mid-call, brief refusal window)
as permanent, so a short network blip fails the whole tool call —
and therefore the agent's turn — instead of reconnecting and
retrying like the LLM retry path does for ``ConnectionError`` /
``httpx.NetworkError``.

The chain is real end to end: a FastMCP streamable-HTTP subprocess
(``tests/tools/fixtures/echo_http_mcp_server.py``) is reached through
an in-process TCP proxy that can inject a controllable outage
("blip"): it severs every live connection mid-stream and refuses new
ones for a short window, then recovers. The test drives a real
:class:`omnigent.tools.mcp.McpServerConnection` through a warm call,
injects a blip shorter than the retry budget, and asserts the next
tool call still round-trips — which requires the connection layer to
classify the blip as transient and reconnect-retry.

Expected today (bug): the blipped call raises (``McpError`` request
timeout, or an ``httpx`` transport error) instead of retrying, so
the assertion fails. After the fix it must pass.

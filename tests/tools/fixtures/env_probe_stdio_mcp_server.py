"""Minimal stdio MCP server that reports its own process environment.

Used by :mod:`tests.tools.test_mcp_stdio_e2e` to prove the runner-auth
secret is stripped from the env handed to a spec-author-controlled MCP
subprocess, while a benign ``config.env`` overlay still
reaches it. Exposes a single ``read_env`` tool that returns the value
of a requested variable as seen by *this* subprocess.

Kept deterministic and dependency-free (only ``mcp``) so the e2e test
needs no external services or credentials.

Usage:

    python tests/tools/fixtures/env_probe_stdio_mcp_server.py

``FastMCP.run()`` defaults to stdio transport.

"""Stdio MCP server used by :mod:`tests.e2e.test_mcp_elicitation_user_answer`.

Exposes a single ``deploy`` tool that, when called, sends an
``elicitation/create`` to the client asking which environment to
deploy to.  The schema is::

    {
      "type": "object",
      "properties": {
        "answer": {"type": "string", "enum": ["dev", "staging", "prod"]}
      }
    }

The tool returns the answer it received from the elicitation result so
the test can assert the correct value reached the server.

This is the exact shape that trips the bug: an enum with three
values and NO "allow" entry, so the auto-fill path in
``_build_accept_content`` returns the first value ("dev") instead of
the one the user actually picked.  When the bug is present the tool
returns ``"elicit_answer:dev"`` regardless of what the user chose.
When the bug is fixed it returns the actual selection.

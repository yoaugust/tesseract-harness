"""Unit tests for ``omnigent.spec.omnigent.agent_spec_to_agent_def``.

Phase 1 ships the forward direction only. These tests hand-craft
:class:`AgentSpec` objects and assert the resulting
:class:`omnigent.datamodel.AgentDef` has the expected shape. The
round-trip test (``agent_spec_to_agent_def(agent_def_to_agent_spec(d)) == d``)
lands in phase 2 once the reverse direction exists.

Fail-loud tests cover every phase-2-or-later concept the translator
explicitly rejects: policies, sandbox, MCP servers, and cancellable-
function tools. Each test asserts the error message names the
specific spec field so the caller can act on it.

    ``acp:<slug>`` survives ``agent_def_to_agent_spec`` intact.

    This is the path a harness launch actually takes: the omnigent loader parses
    the YAML into an :class:`AgentDef`, the reverse translator turns it into an
    ``AgentSpec``, and ``_build_acp_spawn_env`` then resolves which configured ACP
    agent to launch by reading the slug back off ``executor.config["harness"]``.
    The reverse translator used to canonicalize ``acp:<slug>`` down to ``acp``,
    making the slug unrecoverable — so every ``acp:<slug>`` launch silently
    spawned the *first* configured ACP agent instead of the requested one.

    **What breaks if this fails**: ``omnigent run --harness acp:devin`` runs
    somebody else's agent (whichever is first in the ``acp:`` config block)
    while the UI still reports the one that was asked for.

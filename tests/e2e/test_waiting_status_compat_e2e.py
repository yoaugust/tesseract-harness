"""E2E backward-compat guard: a runner that emits ``session.status: waiting``
must not 500 an older server.

When a parent turn ends while a dispatched sub-agent is still running, the
runner publishes ``session.status = "waiting"``. Servers older than 0.3.0 model
``SessionResponse.status`` as ``Literal["idle", "running", "failed"]`` — there
is no ``"waiting"`` — so a naive emit raises a Pydantic ``ValidationError`` and
a 500 on ``GET /v1/sessions/{id}``. The runner's ``/api/version`` gate downgrades
``"waiting"`` -> ``"running"`` against such servers so the response stays
serializable.

This test guards that downgrade end to end: it dispatches a sub-agent (forcing
the parent into the waiting state) and asserts the session stays queryable
(HTTP 200, never 500) across a sustained poll window. It deliberately does NOT
assert the sub-agent result surfaces — auto-wake is a server-side feature older
servers lack, and against such a server the parent sits in the waiting state
the whole time, which is exactly when the un-downgraded 500 would fire. Only the
no-500 runner-side guarantee is checked, and that must hold on EVERY server.

This is the regression guard for the runner waiting-status fix, so unlike the
sub-agent auto-wake tests it is **intentionally NOT** ``min_server_version``-
marked: it must run against pre-0.3.0 servers (that is the whole point). It
fails against such a server when the runner does not downgrade (the 500), and
passes once the runner gates the status — while remaining a trivial pass on a
current server (which serializes ``"waiting"`` natively).

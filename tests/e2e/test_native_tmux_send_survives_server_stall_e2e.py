"""E2E regression: a too-short claude-native tmux send timeout kills workers
when the tmux server responds slowly.

The reported journey: a polly mission dispatches to a ``claude-native`` worker
on a large worktree; the parallel boots pin the machine, the per-session tmux
server is starved for a few seconds, the first ``tmux send-keys`` exceeds the
hardcoded ``_TMUX_SEND_TIMEOUT_S = 5.0`` budget, and the worker dies with
``claude_code failed on infra (tmux command timed out after 5.0s)`` — even
though the caller allowed a 30s delivery window and the tmux server recovers
seconds later. ``cursor_native_bridge`` gives the identical operation 10s.

This test drives the real transport end-to-end: a real tmux server on a
private socket, advertised through the production ``write_tmux_target``, and a
delivery through the public ``inject_interrupt`` entry point (the web-UI Stop
path — the same ``_run_tmux`` send that delivers every keystroke, including
the first dispatch message). The load condition is injected deterministically
by SIGSTOPping the tmux server for STALL_S seconds — exactly what CPU
starvation does to it — with the resume guaranteed by a timer.

Before the fix: ``inject_interrupt`` raises ``RuntimeError: tmux command
timed out after 5.0s`` at t=5 and this test FAILS.
After a fix (larger/configurable send budget, or send retries): the delivery
survives the 7s stall — well inside the caller's 30s window — and it PASSES.

Runs with no LLM, no claude binary, and no server — only ``tmux``::

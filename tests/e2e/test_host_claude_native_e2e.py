"""End-to-end regression test for the claude-native first-message readiness gate.

Covers the host-spawned Web UI flow for ``claude-native-ui``: list hosts
→ create a session with ``host_id`` + ``workspace`` → the server launches
a runner on the host → the runner auto-creates a Claude Code terminal →
the user's first message is injected into that terminal.

The bug this guards against (the "AWAIT TERMINAL UP" race): the runner
advertises ``tmux.json`` as soon as the tmux session exists, but Claude
Code's input box mounts several seconds later, and Claude flushes any
pending terminal input when its TUI initializes. So a first message
typed into that gap is silently dropped — the UI shows "Working…"
forever and nothing is persisted. ``inject_user_message`` now waits for
Claude's input prompt to render before typing (see
``omnigent.harnesses.claude_native.bridge._wait_for_claude_prompt_ready``).

Making the race deterministic
-----------------------------
On a warm machine Claude can boot fast enough that the first message
lands even without the gate, which would make this a flaky / vacuous
test. To pin the regression, the runner launches ``claude`` through a
wrapper (first on ``PATH``) that:

1. ``sleep``\\ s for :data:`_BOOT_DELAY_S` so the input box reliably
   renders *after* the runner would otherwise inject, and
2. flushes pending terminal input (``termios.tcflush``) right before
   exec'ing the real ``claude`` — faithfully modeling Claude Code's
   own boot-time input flush, which is what discards early keystrokes.

With the wrapper, a pre-prompt inject is reliably lost: **gate absent →
this test fails (marker never answered); gate present → it passes.**
Verified red→green by toggling the gate.

Environment requirements (why this is opt-in, not pure-CI):

* **Opt-in only**: set ``OMNIGENT_E2E_CLAUDE_NATIVE=1`` to run. claude-native
  needs an *interactive* Claude login (OAuth/Enterprise) anchored to the
  real ``$HOME`` — it cannot be relocated into CI (verified: a copied
  ``~/.claude.json`` reports "Not logged in"). The ``claude`` binary IS
  present in CI (claude-sdk installs it), so gating on binary presence
  alone would let this run unauthenticated and hang the TUI until the
  shard times out. The env-var gate keeps it out of CI entirely; a
  developer with a logged-in Claude opts in explicitly.
* It runs the daemon under the real HOME with the real Claude login —
  like ``claude_coder`` relies on the CLI's own session.
* The workspace folder must be trusted in ``~/.claude.json`` or Claude
  shows its folder-trust dialog, which blocks (and confounds) the gate.
  The test trusts a temp workspace and restores the original config on
  teardown. It does NOT touch ``~/.omnigent/config.yaml``: the test
  server is a fresh random-port instance, so the daemon's real host
  identity registers there with no collision.

claude-native authenticates through the Claude CLI's own session, so
``--llm-api-key`` only satisfies the server fixture. Derive it from the
oss profile::

    Each item appears exactly once after the first turn on a cold session.

    Regression for the double-forwarder race: on cold start two concurrent
    code paths could both reach ``_auto_create_claude_terminal`` — the
    runner's ``_on_runner_connect`` (via ``create_session``, which holds
    ``_claude_terminal_ensure_locks``) and the first-message path's
    ``_ensure_native_terminal_ready`` (via ``create_session_terminal`` with
    ``ensure_native_terminal=True``, which was previously unguarded).

    Each call spawned an independent transcript forwarder task; each
    forwarder independently posted every transcript item via
    ``external_conversation_item`` — doubling every user message and
    assistant response in the DB. The fix adds
    ``_claude_terminal_ensure_locks`` to the ``create_session_terminal``
    claude path so the second concurrent caller finds the already-created
    terminal and returns without spawning a second forwarder.

    The race window is widest on remote hosts where
    ``_auto_create_claude_terminal`` makes several sequential HTTP calls
    back to the AP server (seconds of latency). Locally the window is
    sub-millisecond and the race rarely fires without artificial delay, so
    the unit test ``test_claude_terminal_ensure_concurrent_calls_create_once``
    (in ``tests/runner/test_session_resources.py``) covers the concurrent
    lock semantics deterministically. This test covers the end-to-end
    path: one turn → exactly one user item, exactly one assistant item.

"""
End-to-end smoke test for the per-harness wraps with a real LLM
behind each, against the session-keyed harness API surface.

Parametrized across every harness wrap registered in
:data:`omnigent.runtime.harnesses._HARNESS_MODULES`. For each:
spawn a real harness subprocess via
:class:`HarnessProcessManager`, drive a turn via the session-keyed
``POST /v1/sessions/{conversation_id}/events`` endpoint with a
deterministic prompt, and verify the full round-trip works:

- The runner subprocess loads the wrap module
  (e.g. :mod:`omnigent.inner.claude_sdk_harness` or
  :mod:`omnigent.inner.codex_harness`).
- Reads its ``HARNESS_<HARNESS>_*`` env vars (per-spawn, per
  harness contract step 5a).
- Constructs a real inner Executor configured for the Databricks
  gateway against the user's profile.
- Routes the turn through the wrapped SDK + Databricks gateway.
- Streams ``response.output_text.delta`` events back.
- Closes with ``response.completed``.

This test scopes to the harness wrap (subprocess + scaffold)
directly — not the AP-level session lifecycle. The
``HarnessProcessManager`` spawns a per-conversation subprocess
whose scaffold owns exactly one conversation_id, validated via
``app.state.conversation_id``. No prior AP-level session
creation is needed, and the scaffold's
``POST /v1/sessions/{id}/events`` endpoint returns the SSE
stream directly as the HTTP response (no separate subscribe
hop, unlike the AP-level :mod:`omnigent.runtime.session_stream`
pub-sub).

Gated on ``--profile`` (the existing tests/conftest.py option).
Without it, the tests skip. Run with::

    .venv/bin/python -m pytest \\
        tests/e2e/test_harness_wrap_e2e.py \\
        --profile test-profile -v

Each harness's params are parametrized so the test ID surfaces
the harness in the test name (``[claude-sdk]`` / ``[codex]``)
and a per-harness assertion failure is visible without
re-reading the parametrize tuple.

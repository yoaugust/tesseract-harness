"""End-to-end repro: kimi-native silently loses a message dispatched during a slow TUI boot.

The reported journey: a kimi-native session's first boot can exceed 30s
(kimi 0.34.0 cold start with an OAuth refresh took ~36s in the live repro).
A message dispatched during that boot is silently lost:

1. ``inject_user_message``'s readiness gate ``_settle_pane`` hits its 30s
   deadline (``_TMUX_READY_TIMEOUT_S``) and **falls through silently**,
   blind-pasting into a still-booting TUI that discards the input on mount.
2. The paste-needle wait and the blind Enter land before/into an empty input
   box; nothing is submitted.
3. ``KimiNativeExecutor.run_turn`` yields ``TurnComplete`` unconditionally, so
   the session is marked idle. No error surfaces anywhere; a parent
   orchestrator waits forever.

This test drives the REAL product path a web-UI message send executes on the
harness side — ``KimiNativeExecutor.run_turn`` → ``inject_user_message`` →
tmux bracketed paste + Enter — against a real tmux pane. Only the kimi binary
is substituted (it is not installable/authenticatable in CI): the pane runs a
stand-in TUI that boots slower than the readiness gate, then mounts an input
box + the ``context:`` footer and, like a real TUI initializing the terminal,
flushes input buffered during boot (the live repro's observed end state was a
mounted but EMPTY input box). After mounting it records every line it receives.

Contract asserted (fails on unfixed main, passes once the injection path is
hardened): **a turn that reports success must have delivered its message** —
either the TUI actually received the text, or the turn must surface an error.
On unfixed main the turn completes "successfully" while the message was never
delivered, which is exactly the silent loss users hit.

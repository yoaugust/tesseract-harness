"""E2E test: list_comments and update_comment tools in claude-native mode.

Verifies the full round-trip for native Claude Code sessions: the test
starts Claude Code in a private tmux window with the Omnigent MCP
bridge, adds review comments via the REST API, sends a message
(which triggers the runner to write ``tool_relay.json`` so the bridge
exposes ``list_comments`` / ``update_comment`` to Claude), and then
confirms the server reflects the expected ``"addressed"`` status on
all comments.

The test uses the same ``claude-native-ui`` agent spec that
``omnigent claude`` materialises at runtime — not a custom yaml.
This ensures comment-relay behaviour is tested against the exact agent
configuration end users encounter.

Requirements
------------
- ``claude`` CLI on PATH and authenticated.
- ``tmux`` on PATH (needed to run Claude Code headlessly in a test).

Both checks are performed at the start of the test; the test skips
cleanly when either binary is missing rather than failing mid-run.

    Claude Code addresses review comments without being told which tools to use.

    Flow:
    1. Skip unless opted in via ``OMNIGENT_E2E_CLAUDE_NATIVE_COMMENTS`` and
       the ``claude`` / ``tmux`` binaries are available.
    2. Create a runner-bound session with the ``claude-native-ui`` agent.
    3. Start Claude Code in a private tmux window with the Omnigent
       MCP bridge (same as ``omnigent claude`` does).
    4. POST two draft comments on ``app.py`` via the REST API.
    5. Pre-configure the mock LLM with tool-call responses that call
       ``list_comments`` then ``update_comment`` for both comment IDs so the
       mock server drives the MCP relay round-trip deterministically.
    6. Ask the agent to address all open comments via the REST API.
       The prompt explicitly says "use your available tools" and "in this
       session" so Claude targets the MCP relay tools (not GitHub CLI).
       Because this test launches Claude in its own tmux window (not via the
       runner terminal route), the relay is started by the runner's first-turn
       fallback, which:
       a. Writes ``tool_relay.json`` (the comment-relay start).
       b. Awaits the ``notifications/tools/list_changed`` delivery so Claude
          re-fetches its tool list before the message is injected.
       c. Injects the user message into Claude's tmux window.
    7. Poll comment statuses until both are ``"addressed"`` or timeout.
    8. Assert both comments have status ``"addressed"``.

    **What breaks if this test fails:**

    - ``_ensure_comment_relay_started`` in ``runner/app.py`` not called for
      claude-native turns, so ``tool_relay.json`` is never written.
    - The MCP bridge does not read ``tool_relay.json`` on ``tools/list``
      requests, so the relay tools are invisible to Claude.
    - The relay HTTP server is not running or not callable from the bridge,
      so Claude's tool call returns an error.
    - ``_execute_comment_tool`` call path broken (server_client / session
      scoping), so the Omnigent server ``PATCH /v1/sessions/{id}/comments`` is
      never hit.
    - Comments still ``"draft"`` → update path didn't persist.

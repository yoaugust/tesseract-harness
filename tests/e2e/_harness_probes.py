"""
Shared parametrize probes for e2e tests that should run against
every wrapped harness.

Each :class:`HarnessProbe` describes one harness + model + marker
tuple. e2e tests import :data:`HARNESS_PROBES` and use it as the
``parametrize`` argvalues so a single test ID per harness shows
up (``[claude-sdk]``, ``[codex]``, etc.) and a per-harness failure
is visible without re-reading the parametrize tuple.

Add a new entry here when a new harness wrap lands in
:data:`omnigent.runtime.harnesses._HARNESS_MODULES`. Every
parametrized e2e test then picks up the new harness without
per-file edits.

    """One row of the harness parametrize matrix.

    :param harness: The harness name as registered in
        ``_HARNESS_MODULES`` and used by
        :meth:`HarnessProcessManager.get_client`, e.g.
        ``"claude-sdk"``.
    :param model: The model identifier the inner executor
        receives via the harness's ``HARNESS_<HARNESS>_MODEL``
        env var (or, for AP-level tests, the model field in
        the agent spec). Must be a real model the Databricks
        gateway exposes for the user's profile.
    :param env_prefix: The env-var prefix the wrap reads
        (e.g. ``HARNESS_CLAUDE_SDK_``). The model-routing env
        vars are derived as ``{prefix}MODEL``,
        ``{prefix}GATEWAY``, ``{prefix}DATABRICKS_PROFILE``.
        Used by the harness-wrap smoke test that talks
        directly to ``HarnessProcessManager``.
    :param marker: The exact literal string the LLM is asked
        to echo back in marker-based tests. Per-harness
        markers keep concurrent runs of different harnesses
        from cross-matching against each other in the
        assertion path.
    :param cli_binary: Name of the CLI binary the inner
        executor requires on PATH (e.g. ``"claude"``,
        ``"codex"``, ``"pi"``). ``None`` when no binary check
        is meaningful (the inner executor's failure path
        surfaces a clear error of its own). Tests can call
        :func:`skip_if_harness_cli_missing` to skip the
        harness's parametrize row when its CLI isn't
        installed locally.

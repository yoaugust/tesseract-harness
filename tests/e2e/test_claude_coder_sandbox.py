"""E2E test: Claude SDK executor sandbox isolation (mock LLM).

Verifies that the Claude SDK executor's sandbox restricts file
access to the workspace directory. Built-in tools (Read, Edit,
Write) are blocked by PreToolUse hooks. Bash writes are blocked
by the OS-level sandbox (Seatbelt/bubblewrap).

Each test registers an inline ``claude-sdk`` agent backed by the
mock LLM server, configures the mock to return a specific tool
call (Read, Write, Glob, Edit targeting a path outside the
workspace), and asserts the sandbox prevents the operation.
No API key needed — runs against the mock LLM server.

Usage::

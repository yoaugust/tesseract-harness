"""End-to-end tests for the Phase 4 named-sub-agent pipeline.

Coverage of:

* ``test_spawn_named_sub_agent_e2e`` — the LLM picks up the
  ``sys_session_send(agent, title, args)`` signature and a child
  conversation persists with title="<agent>:<title>".
* ``test_send_to_named_sub_agent_continuation_e2e`` — turn 2
  uses ``sys_session_send`` to continue the existing child;
  the child's history accumulates across turns.
* ``test_ambient_hint_steers_followup_to_send_e2e`` — turn 2's
  user prompt is neutral; the LLM uses the ambient hint
  ("Open sub-agents:") to choose ``sys_session_send`` over a
  duplicate spawn (the critical D6 test — if it fails, named
  persistence is useless because the LLM forgets across turns).
* ``test_parallel_named_sub_agents_e2e`` — both researcher
  ("first") and summarizer ("second") in one turn; both
  markers reach the final reply.
* ``test_cross_parent_named_isolation_e2e`` — same name in two
  separate top-level conversations doesn't leak.

Always uses mock-LLM mode. The fixture agent bundle is uploaded
(it declares the sub-agent specs the runner needs) and responses
come from the mock LLM server's keyed queues.

Each turn is driven through a runner-bound session: the agent
bundle is registered (``upload_agent`` rewrites the native
``gpt-5.4`` model to a Databricks-served name and stamps the
``--profile`` onto the executor blocks), a session is created and
bound to the live runner, and the user message is posted to
``POST /v1/sessions/{id}/events``. The terminal turn is read from
the session snapshot — the legacy ``POST /v1/responses`` route was
removed. Multi-turn tests reuse the same session id, so continuation
is implicit (no ``previous_response_id``).

``sys_session_send`` is async: the sub-agent runs AFTER the parent's
dispatch turn ends, then auto-wakes the parent in a continuation turn
that reads the inbox and surfaces the result. So a sub-agent marker
lands in the session only after the first idle — tests
:func:`_wait_for_markers` (poll the snapshot) rather than read the
dispatch turn's terminal reply, mirroring ``test_subagent_autowake_e2e``.

Excluded from default ``pytest`` runs via
``--ignore=tests/e2e``. Invoke with::

# Each test is 3+ serial gateway turns (dispatch + sub-agent + auto-wake
# continuation), so FMAPI 429 backoff stacks multiplicatively and the
# suite-wide 180s cap hard-killed the xdist worker (thread method calls
# os._exit, wedging the shard). 600s absorbs the backoff; the signal
# method is safe here, unlike the pexpect/pty tests the workflow's
# thread default protects, because these tests block only in
# main-thread httpx polls, so the worker survives and fixtures tear
# down on a genuine timeout.
# These sub-agent tests drive each child agent through per-sub-agent mock-LLM
# routing — every child runs on its own mock model and auth.base_url. A server
# < 0.3.0 does not propagate the sub-agent executor's mock base_url (fixed in
# #779, which added auth to the inner ExecutorSpec; it landed ~2h after v0.2.0
# was tagged, so v0.2.0 just missed it), so the child harness reaches the real
# gateway and its mock-only model name is rejected (HTTP 400); the child returns
# nothing, so the parent's auto-wake has nothing to surface. Verified against a
# v0.2.0 server: the child 400s on the real gateway while auto-wake itself works
# (waiting downgraded, no 500). This is a mock-LLM test-infrastructure gap, not
# a product regression. The backwards-compat matrix skips these against servers
# < 0.3.0 via min_server_version; they run unchanged on main and in the gate.

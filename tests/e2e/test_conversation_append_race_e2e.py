"""
End-to-end regression for the conversation_items position race
(2026-04-30 user-reported ``UNIQUE constraint failed`` symptom).

This test runs a REAL Omnigent server subprocess against a REAL SQLite
database, then drives many concurrent ``append()`` calls
through the live ``SqlAlchemyConversationStore`` instance the
server's ``ConversationStore`` was wired with at startup. The
goal is to prove the position-race fix (lock escalation in
:meth:`SqlAlchemyConversationStore._lock_conversation`) holds
when:

1. The store is constructed in a separate process from the
   test (matches the user's ``omnigent run`` setup
   where the Omnigent server is a subprocess of the REPL).
2. The store's session factory + busy_timeout pragmas come
   from the production code path
   (:func:`omnigent.db.utils.make_managed_session_maker`),
   not a test-only override.

The bug shape: the user's REPL session 2026-04-30 hit
``sqlite3.IntegrityError: UNIQUE constraint failed:
conversation_items.conversation_id, conversation_items.position``
when the agent loop's incremental tool-call persist raced the
steering inbox's auto-injection of idle-notification user
messages. Two concurrent appends both ran ``select(max(position))``
inside DEFERRED transactions (no write lock), both saw the same
``max_pos``, both inserted at ``max_pos + 1``, and the loser
crashed with the IntegrityError. The fix escalates the
transaction to RESERVED via a no-op UPDATE in
``_lock_conversation``, which forces SQLite to serialize the
two transactions on the busy_timeout instead of racing the
SELECT.

This e2e test:

- Spins up an Omnigent server subprocess (:fixture:`ap_server`).
- Imports the Omnigent server's actual ``SqlAlchemyConversationStore``
  via the same ``get_or_create_engine`` cache the server uses,
  pointing at the same DB file.
- Fires N concurrent appends from M threads in this test
  process against the SHARED database file.
- Asserts no thread raised ``IntegrityError`` and final
  positions are contiguous.

If the lock-escalation fix regresses, this test surfaces the
exact ``IntegrityError`` the user reported. The store-level
unit/integration tests in
``tests/stores/test_conversation_store.py`` cover the same
race in-process; this test is the cross-process regression
gate (catches the case where a future engine-cache change
makes the busy_timeout pragma not apply across all session
factories).

    With a live Omnigent server running, fire N concurrent appends
    from this test process against the SAME SQLite DB file the
    server is using. No append must raise IntegrityError; final
    positions must be contiguous.

    What this proves and what a failure means:

    - The lock-escalation fix in
      :meth:`SqlAlchemyConversationStore._lock_conversation`
      works against a database file shared with another process
      (the Omnigent server). On revert, the test surfaces the user's
      exact ``UNIQUE constraint failed`` error.
    - The production engine-cache + session-factory wiring
      (``get_or_create_engine`` + ``make_managed_session_maker``)
      applies the ``busy_timeout=20000`` PRAGMA to every
      session, so the second writer blocks rather than failing
      fast on SQLITE_BUSY.

    Note: this test does NOT exercise the Omnigent route layer (the
    HTTP append endpoint doesn't exist; appends go through
    workflow execution which needs an LLM). Coverage of the
    HTTP path is captured by the workflow integration tests
    in ``tests/runtime/test_workflow.py`` and the live REPL
    re-runs documented in CLAUDE.md's "Mandatory REPL
    Verification" section.

"""End-to-end regression tests for codex-native fork-resume history.

The codex-native mirror of ``test_host_claude_native_fork_e2e``: a forked
codex-native session, resumed on the same host, must carry the source's
Codex *rollout* history into the clone's own thread so the agent can
recall it. Both resume shapes are exercised:

1. **Same working directory** — the clone resumes in the source's exact
   workspace.
2. **New git worktree** — the clone resumes in a freshly created worktree
   off the source repo.

The regression these guard against: codex forks used to resume *fresh* —
they got the copied Omnigent transcript as context but not Codex's
internal thread / rollout state. The current path clones the source
rollout into the clone's own ``CODEX_HOME`` under a freshly minted thread
id (``_clone_codex_rollout``) and launches ``codex resume
<our_thread_id>``. If that regresses, the clone launches fresh (no Codex
history) and the recall assertion below fails. This also exercises the
prerequisite that a host-spawned codex source records its
``external_session_id`` on discovery (otherwise the fork would have no
source thread id to clone).

Opt-in (same rationale as ``test_host_codex_native_e2e``): codex-native
needs ``codex`` on PATH and real model credentials. Set
``OMNIGENT_E2E_CODEX_NATIVE=1`` to run::

"""E2E regression test: a 300s forward-loop stall must not duplicate committed items.

Reproduces the user-reported bug: the claude-native transcript forwarder wraps
each poll iteration in ``asyncio.timeout(_FORWARD_LOOP_STALL_DEADLINE_S)`` (300s
in production). When one iteration stalls mid-batch (a loaded host, a slow POST,
a large backlog), the deadline cancels the stalled await and the loop resumes.

The forwarder advances its persisted transcript cursor only after a whole batch
is consumed, and the in-memory ``seen_source_ids`` accumulated during the
cancelled iteration is discarded with the interrupted call frame. So the next
iteration re-reads the batch from its start and re-POSTs every item. Because
``_post_external_conversation_item`` sends no ``source_id`` and the server does
not dedupe ``external_conversation_item`` events, every re-post commits a
**duplicate row**. On a session whose iteration reliably exceeds the deadline
this is a permanent 5-minute replay loop that duplicated three production
transcripts 500-750x and grew ``conversation_items`` to 26 GB, taking the
database read-only.

This test drives the REAL user path end to end: a real ``omnigent server``
subprocess (so the real ``POST /v1/sessions/<id>/events`` route and the real
``_persist_external_conversation_item`` commit path run -- the exact "no
server-side idempotency" seam), a real claude-native session, and the real
``forward_claude_transcript_to_session`` loop tailing a seeded Claude JSONL
transcript. The reported trigger -- a stalled await mid-iteration -- is injected
as a fault: the POST of the *second* transcript item hangs on its first attempt,
so the (shortened) iteration deadline cancels it exactly as a slow production
POST would, and the loop resumes and replays.

Desired behavior (asserted): each distinct transcript item is committed to the
server EXACTLY ONCE, even across a stall + resume. Buggy behavior: the item that
was already committed before the stall is committed a SECOND time when the whole
batch replays, so ``GET /v1/sessions/<id>/items`` returns it twice and this test
FAILS with the duplicate count in the message.

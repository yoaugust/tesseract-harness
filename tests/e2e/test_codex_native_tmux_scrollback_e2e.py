"""E2E regression: a native attach to an Omnigent-managed tmux terminal must be
able to reach the formatted scrollback above the viewport.

The reported journey: run ``omnigent codex`` from a native terminal, produce
more conversation output than fits the viewport, then scroll up with the mouse
wheel or press Page Up. Nothing moved — the view stayed pinned at the bottom and
earlier formatted output was unreachable, even though tmux's history buffer
held it (an affected session reported ``history=288`` with
``history-limit 100000``).

Why: the managed tmux server had disabled every entry point into tmux copy
mode — ``mouse off`` (so wheel events never reached ``WheelUpPane``),
``prefix None`` + ``prefix2 None`` + an emptied prefix table (so ``prefix [``
is gone), and no root-table binding mapped Page Up to ``copy-mode`` (so the key
passed through to the inner CLI, which ignores it: Codex handles neither the
wheel nor Page Up, since it renders inline and leaves scrolling to the host
terminal). The user's own ``~/.tmux.conf`` cannot restore any of this because
the native client attaches with ``-f /dev/null``.

Both routes are now open: ``mouse on`` for the wheel and a root-table Page Up
binding for the keyboard. The wheel must still be *forwarded* to a pane that
tracks the mouse, so a full-screen TUI keeps its own wheel handling.

This test drives the real product path end-to-end, with no LLM and no codex
binary (codex-native needs an interactive OAuth login, so the inner CLI is a
stand-in that fills the pane the way a Codex conversation does — the tmux
configuration and the attach command are the production ones):

1. Launch a managed terminal through the production ``TerminalRegistry`` (the
   same path the codex-native runner uses), with a pane command that emits far
   more lines than the 80x24 viewport.
2. Attach a real client PTY with the exact command ``omnigent codex`` execs in
   ``omnigent.harnesses.codex_native.main._attach_direct_tmux``:
   ``tmux -S <socket> -f /dev/null attach -t main`` (with ``TMUX`` stripped).
3. Deliver the user's scroll gestures through the attached client: Page Up,
   then SGR mouse wheel-up.
4. Assert some gesture reached the scrollback — the pane enters a scrolled
   (copy-mode) state with a non-zero scroll offset.

Without a scrollback route no gesture enters copy mode (``pane_in_mode`` stays
``0``, ``scroll_position`` stays empty), the earliest visible line is still the
last screenful, and these tests FAIL.

Runs with only ``tmux`` and ``pexpect``::

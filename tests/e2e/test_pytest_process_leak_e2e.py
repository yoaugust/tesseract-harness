"""End-to-end regression test: pytest must not leave Omnigent processes behind.

Reproduces the developer journey from the bug report "pytest leaves Omnigent
servers and host daemons running after the suite exits":

1. run pytest on a CLI test that spawns a real detached Omnigent child,
2. pytest exits (green) and removes its temp ``OMNIGENT_DATA_DIR``,
3. ``ps`` still shows ``omnigent.host._daemon_entry`` / ``omnigent.cli
   server`` / ``omnigent.runner._zygote`` processes spawned by the run —
   orphans that squat port 6767 (so a later ``omni start`` silently falls
   back to a random port) and keep serving with their database directory
   gone.

The nested run drives the exact leak seam from the report: an ``omnigent
claude --server <url>`` invocation that stubs the native launcher but not
``_ensure_backend``, so the Click command's ``_ensure_host_daemon`` really
Popens ``python -m omnigent.host._daemon_entry`` with
``start_new_session=True``. The target URL is a loopback port nothing
listens on — connection-refused keeps the daemon in its retry loop for
minutes (``_LOOPBACK_REFUSED_FATAL_ATTEMPTS``), so a surviving orphan is
observable deterministically, with no dependence on external-network shape
(the suite's real leaking tests point at ``https://example.com``, whose
orphan lifetime varies with how fast that host answers).

The nested pytest loads ``tests/conftest.py`` as a plugin, so it exercises
the session-level spawn/teardown wiring under test: the conftest points
``OMNIGENT_DATA_DIR`` at a fresh ``mkdtemp(prefix="omnigent-pytest-")``
(honoring ``TMPDIR``), and its ``pytest_unconfigure`` owns reaping.
Confining the nested run to a private ``TMPDIR`` lets survivors be matched
by their environment or command line without ever touching unrelated
processes.

No LLM is needed — this is pure process-lifecycle wiring — so it runs
without ``--llm-api-key``::

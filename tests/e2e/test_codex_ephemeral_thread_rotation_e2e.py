"""Regression test for codex-native unusable with Codex CLI 0.150.1.

With Codex CLI 0.150.1, a normal first turn emits a *second*
``thread/started`` about nine seconds in, for a ``system`` thread with
``ephemeral=true`` and ``path=null``. Omnigent's forwarder treats every
non-subagent ``thread/started`` whose id differs from the active thread as a
user ``/clear`` and rotates the parent Omnigent session onto that thread
(``_maybe_rotate_session_on_thread_started`` ->
``_create_thread_replacement_session``). The session is now bound to a
non-persistable thread: the real turn's output is rejected as stale and goal
operations fail with ``ephemeral thread does not support goals``.

Why fault-injection instead of driving the live TUI
----------------------------------------------------
The triggering event is emitted only by Codex CLI **0.150.1**; the known-good
0.149.0 never emits it (per the reporter's isolated A/B run). The runner here
does not have 0.150.1 installed, so the user-facing web journey (submit a turn,
get no result) cannot be driven end to end on this build. We therefore inject
the *exact* system/ephemeral ``thread/started`` envelope from the report into
the **real** forwarder rotation entry point and assert on the real session
rotation it drives (create + bind + external-session + terminal transfer +
bridge-state rewrite via the recording AP client).

This mirrors the four regression cases the report asks for:

1. an ``ephemeral=true`` / ``threadSource=system`` ``thread/started`` must NOT
   rotate or rebind the parent session (the bug: it currently does);
2. a non-ephemeral top-level thread (a real user ``/clear``) must STILL rotate;
3. existing sub-agent ``thread/started`` handling must remain unchanged (no
   rotation);
4. after the ephemeral event the forwarder target must remain bound to the
   persistent parent thread, so goal operations stay routed to a real thread.

Case 1 and case 4 FAIL on the buggy build (rotation happens) and pass once the
fix ignores ephemeral/system ``thread/started`` before any state change.

"""CUJ 4 — codex-native in-harness routing of the first message TYPED into the TUI.

The codex half of CUJ 3, plus the two things only codex can show:

* **The applied spelling is codex's own slug.** Codex serves either spelling but
  recognizes only its own, so an untranslated switch runs the right model while
  the TUI warns about missing metadata and ``/model`` keeps highlighting the
  launch slug. The hook translates before ``thread/settings/update`` and mirrors
  the accepted value into the session's ``config.toml`` — which must therefore
  read ``gpt-5.6-luna``, not ``databricks-gpt-5-6-luna``.
* **``/model`` highlights the routed arm.** The picker reads the live thread, so
  the routed arm showing up there is what proves the switch reached the process
  rather than only the file.

The gate for the fast skip is the session's **routing-decision label**, not the
bridge-dir marker and not ``model_override``; the marker is a local optimization
that saves a round trip. Turn 2 must therefore issue zero routing calls.

The prompt is typed, never POSTed — see CUJ 3's module docstring for why.

A 5x repeat variant burns in the block-and-replay handshake, whose failure mode
is a timing race. It multiplies an already slow suite, so it is gated behind
``OMNIGENT_E2E_RELIABILITY=1`` on top of the suite's own opt-in.

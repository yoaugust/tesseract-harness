"""E2E test: default executor auto-collects sub-agent results (mock LLM).

Verifies that sub-agent auto-collection works for the default (LLM)
executor path — the same task store query that was added for the
Claude SDK executor. Uses inline agents (parent + summarizer) with
mock LLM responses so no real API key is needed.

# model + auth.base_url), which a server < 0.3.0 does not propagate (fixed in
# #779, which landed ~2h after v0.2.0 was tagged) — the child reaches the real
# gateway and fails, so its result never surfaces (see
# test_named_sub_agent_persistence.py for the verified mechanism). A mock-LLM
# test-infra gap, not a product regression. The backwards-compat matrix skips
# this against servers < 0.3.0; it runs unchanged on main.

"""End-to-end tests for :class:`omnigent.inner.kimi_executor.KimiExecutor`.

Real-binary tests gated on:

- ``OMNIGENT_E2E_KIMI=1`` in the environment, and
- the ``kimi`` binary (or whichever ``HARNESS_KIMI_PATH`` points at)
  present on PATH.

When either gate fails the test is skipped — keeps CI green without the
upstream binary while still letting maintainers run the happy path locally
with ``OMNIGENT_E2E_KIMI=1 uv run --group test pytest tests/e2e/test_kimi_executor_e2e.py``.

Mirrors ``tests/e2e/test_cursor_executor_e2e.py`` / ``test_pi_executor_e2e.py``
in shape.

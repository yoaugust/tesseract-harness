"""E2E test: codex executor's ``skills:`` field actually filters
which skills the agent sees.

The codex executor populates a per-conversation ``$CODEX_HOME/skills/``
with symlinks to bundle / host skill directories based on the spec's
``skills_filter`` (``"all"`` / ``"none"`` / list). Codex itself
auto-discovers skills under ``$CODEX_HOME/skills/<name>/SKILL.md`` and
injects each skill's name + description into the system prompt.

This test parametrizes the three filter modes against three fixture
agent bundles whose ``skills/`` subdir ships two distinctively-named
SKILL.md files:

- ``codex_e2e_xyz_greet_a3f9c2``
- ``codex_e2e_xyz_count_b8d4e7``

The unique suffixes (``a3f9c2`` / ``b8d4e7``) are unforgable — GPT
cannot hallucinate them, so a string match in the agent's enumerated
output is unambiguous proof codex actually loaded that skill.

    Codex's ``skills:`` filter actually controls what the model sees.

    This is the live e2e regression-pin for the codex skills bridge.
    Loaded with deterministic-name fixtures (suffixes unforgable by
    the LLM) so the assertions can string-match without an LLM judge:
    the presence of ``codex_e2e_xyz_greet_a3f9c2`` in the model's
    output is unambiguous proof codex auto-discovered that skill in
    ``$CODEX_HOME/skills/`` and injected it into the system prompt's
    skill index.

    **What breaks if the feature is wrong:**

    - If ``_populate_codex_skills`` doesn't symlink bundle skills
      (e.g. the bundle source is dropped or the ``"all"`` branch
      broken), the ``"all"`` and ``"list"`` cases find no
      bundle-skill names in the output → ``expected_visible``
      assertion fires with a clear ``not found`` message.
    - If ``_resolve_skills_filter`` defaults to ``"all"`` when the
      AP-side env-var bridge breaks (the original pre-fix
      regression), the ``"none"`` case leaks bundle skills →
      ``expected_hidden`` assertion fires with the leaked name.
    - If the per-name list filter is broken (matches everything or
      matches nothing), the ``"list"`` case fires either branch.
    - If the populator's source priority is broken, the ``"list"``
      case fails because the named skill resolves to neither the
      bundle nor host.

    Each of those breakages produces a specific failure message that
    names the offending skill, so a regression triage can jump
    straight to the right layer.

"""End-to-end regression tests for claude-native fork-resume history.

Covers the two flows verified by hand when implementing the
clone-transcript fork path (see designs/FORK_SESSION_UX.md): a forked
claude-native session, resumed on the same host, must carry the
source's Claude history into the clone's own session so the agent can
recall it. Both resume shapes are exercised:

1. **Same working directory** — the clone resumes in the source's exact
   workspace. The cloned transcript must be written *before* launch so
   the forwarder's ``start_at_end`` seeks past the copied prefix
   (otherwise the whole transcript double-renders into the clone).
2. **New git worktree** — the clone resumes in a freshly created
   worktree off the source repo. Claude's ``--resume`` is cwd-scoped, so
   the cloned transcript must land in the *clone's* project dir (not the
   source's) or the resume silently finds nothing → "terminal resource
   not found".

The regression these guard against: forking used to ask Claude Code to
branch the source via ``--fork-session``, which double-rendered the
same-dir case and could not resume in a new worktree. The current path
clones the source transcript into the clone's own project dir under a
uuid we assign (``_clone_claude_transcript``) and launches plain
``--resume <our_uuid>``. If that regresses, the clone launches *fresh*
(no history) and the recall assertion below fails.

Why this is opt-in (same rationale as ``test_host_claude_native_e2e``):
claude-native needs a real *interactive* Claude login anchored to the
real ``$HOME`` — it cannot be relocated into CI. Set
``OMNIGENT_E2E_CLAUDE_NATIVE=1`` (with ``claude`` installed + logged
in) to run::

"""Phase 0 characterization test — sub-agent visibility in overview.

Migrated to mock LLM: the supervisor is backed by ``openai-agents``
with mock responses. Sub-agent (``claude-sdk`` and ``codex``)
parametrize rows still require the real CLI binary on PATH — those
are skipped when the binary is missing.

The core invariant remains: when a sub-agent session is registered,
the REPL overview pane must render the sub-agent's label, executor
harness, and user message.

**What breaks if this fails:**
- The ``sys_session_send`` builtin's output JSON drops
  ``conversation_id`` — the REPL's overview target registration
  keys on it.
- ``_collect_overview_targets`` stops including managed agent sessions.
- ``_render_overview_managed_session_text`` drops metadata lines.
- The wrapped harness invocation fails, so the worker never comes up.

    Spawn a supervisor that delegates to a sub-agent worker, open

    Uses the mock LLM server for supervisor responses. Sub-agent
    harnesses (claude-sdk, codex) still require their respective CLI
    binaries on PATH — rows fail loudly (not skip) when those are
    absent, see :func:`_check_worker_harness_available`.

    The visibility contract is narrow on purpose: the worker CLI runs
    for real and typically fails to authenticate in the sandbox, so it
    never reaches the mock and produces an error turn. That does not
    matter here — the sub-agent session is registered at *dispatch*
    time (``status: launching``) with the dispatched user message in
    its args, so it appears in the overview regardless of whether the
    worker's own turn succeeds. We assert only that: the sub-agent's
    label and the dispatched user message render. (The overview does
    not render an executor-harness line for sub-agent targets at all —
    that is gated to the main session in ``_repl.py`` — so there is no
    executor-harness assertion.)

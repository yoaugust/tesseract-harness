# `--omnigent` example-YAML coverage: known gaps

Companion to `test_run_omnigent_example_agents.py` and
`test_run_omnigent_adapter_rejections.py`. Tracks gaps the e2e audit
surfaced — real adapter gaps, not per-YAML mistakes. Each gap
has an xfail'd test case so when it's fixed the test flips to
pass automatically.

## Fixed

### Fixed — `cancellable_function` tool runners were rejected

Original symptom: the forward translator wrapped every local
tool in `FunctionTool(callable=...)`, but
`CancellableFunctionTool` took a **runner** — a class instance
with a `.start(args, on_complete)` method, not a plain
callable. Caused `agent_with_tools.yaml` to fail at spec-load
with *"resolves to non-callable SleepToolRunner"*.

Resolution (step (c) of the harness contract migration): the
runner-protocol shape was retired entirely. Every `@tool` /
`type: function` is a plain callable; cancellable behaviour
flows through `sys_call_async` + `sys_cancel_task`. The forward
translator now fail-loud rejects `CancellableFunctionTool` /
`type: cancellable_function` with a migration hint pointing at
the new shape. The example YAMLs and `examples/_shared/tool_functions.py`
were migrated in the same change.

### Fixed — Gap 1: harness auto-selection based on model name

Pure omnigent' CLI auto-picks a harness from the model's
prefix: `databricks-claude-*` → `claude-sdk`, `databricks-gpt-*`
→ `openai-agents`, etc. The `--omnigent` adapter's validator refused
specs without an explicit `harness:` field, so every YAML that
relied on pure-omnigent auto-selection failed at spec-load:

```
invalid agent spec synthesized from omnigent YAML:
  executor.config.harness: required when executor.type is
  'omnigent' — must be one of ['claude-sdk', 'codex',
  'openai-agents', 'pi']
```

Fix: added `_infer_harness_from_model` helper in
`omnigent.spec.omnigent` with a `_HARNESS_FOR_MODEL_PREFIX`
lookup. `_translate_executor_from_def` calls it as the final
fallback when no explicit or parent harness is present. The
omnigent CLI's `_apply_overrides_to_yaml` no longer injects a
hard-coded `_AP_DEFAULT_HARNESS = "openai-agents"` fallback — that
band-aid was preventing the adapter's auto-pick from ever firing
(it saw the YAML after the CLI had already baked in the default).

Covered by the unit tests `test_harness_auto_picks_from_model_prefix`
(parametrized over claude/gpt variants) and the e2e cases
`simple_chat` and `agent_with_subagent_session`.

### Fixed — Gap 7: Stock omnigent policy callables don't work under Omnigent

`resolve_function_policy` now detects legacy `(content, phase)` callables at
load time and wraps them in `_omnigent_legacy_shim` — a one-argument adapter
that unpacks the engine's evaluation object into `(content, phase_string)`
before forwarding to the original callable. The shim is transparent: return
values and exceptions propagate unchanged.

The motivating example callables (`examples.tool_functions.block_long_sleep`
and friends) were already rewritten to the modern single-argument signature
before this fix landed, so they no longer exercise the shim path. The shim
exists to protect any user-written omnigent-style policy callables that have
not yet been migrated.

### Fixed — Gap 2: parent-to-inline-AgentTool `harness:` propagation

Inline AgentTools in `coding_supervisor_with_forks.yaml` /
`agent_with_subagent_session.yaml` declare `prompt:`, `os_env:`,
`tools:` but omit `executor:`, expecting the parent's harness
to flow down. The adapter's `_agent_tool_to_sub_spec`
propagated `parent_profile` and `parent_os_env` but NOT
harness. Each sub-spec tripped the `harness-required` validator:

```
sub_agents['worker_a'].executor.config.harness: required when
executor.type is 'omnigent' — must be one of [...]
```

Fix: `_agent_tool_to_sub_spec` and `_translate_executor_from_def`
now accept `parent_harness`. The harness resolution order is
(1) explicit child `executor.harness`, (2) parent_harness,
(3) `_infer_harness_from_model` on the resolved model.
Importantly, the **effective** parent harness (post auto-pick)
is propagated — not the raw YAML value — so a parent that
declares only `model: databricks-gpt-5-4-mini` auto-picks
`openai-agents` and passes that concrete harness down to its
children.

Covered by the unit tests `test_inline_agent_tool_without_executor_inherits_parent_harness`
and `test_inline_agent_tool_explicit_harness_wins_over_parent`,
and the e2e cases `agent_with_subagent_session` and
`coding_supervisor_with_forks`.

## Outstanding gaps

### Gap 3 — `examples/agent_with_os_env.yaml` requires Linux

Not an adapter bug: the example ships with `sandbox:
linux_bwrap` which only works on Linux hosts with bwrap
installed. Orthogonal to `--omnigent`. Needs either an
environment-aware example or a per-OS test override.

### Gap 4 — `agent_with_uc_tools.yaml` untested

UC catalog functions may or may not round-trip through the
adapter cleanly. Needs a minimal real-UC-function fixture
before an e2e can land.

### Gap 5 — `terminal_workers.yaml` harness unknown

Uses `harness: open-responses`, which isn't in the adapter's
validator allowlist (`['claude-sdk', 'codex', 'openai-agents',
'pi']`). Expected to fail at spec-load with a harness-required
error, but the adapter reads `harness` as a plain string so
the actual error is unclear. Needs investigation.

### Gap 8 — Can't ban a specific sub-agent by name

If your omnigent YAML declares a sub-agent tool named
`worker` and you want a policy that denies calls to it, the
natural thing to write is `match_tools: [worker]`. That doesn't
work under Omnigent. Sub-agents are invoked through a generic
`sys_session_send` tool, not by their name directly, so the
policy engine sees `sys_session_send` as the tool name and the
`worker` filter never matches.

Today's workaround: write the policy against `sys_session_send`
and read the sub-agent name from the call's arguments. That
works but it's non-obvious and authors following the omnigent
docs won't expect it.

**Fix options**: (1) rewrite `match_tools: [worker]` at
translation time into a policy that filters on
`sys_session_send` + an arguments check, or (2) expose each
sub-agent as its own first-class tool name so the call sites
match the YAML. Option 2 is cleaner but touches more of the
spawn path.

### Fixed — Gap 6: `--omnigent` hung when FunctionTools were registered on the top-level agent

**Root cause**: the adapter synthesizes `LocalToolInfo.language =
"omnigent-python-callable"` for every user FunctionTool /
CancellableFunctionTool in the YAML. `load_local_python_tools`
intentionally skips entries where `language != "python"` (it
only loads tools that live on disk as `tools/python/*.py`), so
these tools were **advertised** to the inner harness via
`_build_omnigent_tool_schemas` but never **registered** on
Omnigent' `ToolManager`. When the harness's LLM invoked one,
the `_tool_executor` bridge called `context.call_tool`, which
fell through to `await_tool_output` (the client-side tunneling
path) and parked forever waiting for a client that doesn't exist.

**Fix** (in the tool-executor bridge): the bridge takes the
`AgentDef` and dispatches user tools directly:

- `FunctionTool` → call `tool.callable(**args)` directly
  (sync: on the thread pool; async: awaited on the current loop).
- `CancellableFunctionTool` → adapt the runner's
  `start(args, on_complete)` callback-style API to an awaitable
  via `asyncio.Future`, guarded by a 300s timeout.
- Agent-plane builtins (`check_task`, `sys_session_send`, etc.) →
  still route through `context.call_tool` → `ToolManager`.

TOOL_CALL policy enforcement is preserved: the bridge now calls
`context.enforce_tool_call_policy(tool_name, args)` **before**
dispatching, so the same guardrails Omnigent' native tool
loop applies also apply here. On DENY, the sentinel returns as
the tool output instead of invoking the real callable. The
workflow wires the enforcement hook to `_enforce_tool_call_policy`
with the already-built `PolicyEngine`.

Verified by:
- `examples/agent_with_tools.yaml` (xfail removed, passes
  end-to-end through `--omnigent` with the claude-sdk harness).
- `tests/e2e/omnigent/test_run_omnigent_policy_enforcement.py::test_policy_denies_tool_call_by_name`
  (real `omnigent run --omnigent -p "what is 6 + 6?"` subprocess
  with a `type: function` policy narrowed to `calculate` via `action: deny`
  policy; asserts the LLM acknowledged the denial AND "12"
  never appears in output — the tool was short-circuited, not
  dispatched).
- The full rejection + happy-path e2e sweep: 11/11 passing in
  ~125s against the real Databricks gateway.

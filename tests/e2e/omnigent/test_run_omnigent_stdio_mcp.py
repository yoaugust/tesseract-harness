"""Live E2E: ``omnigent run`` calls a stdio MCP tool.

Proves the full path landed by the stdio-MCP work:

    YAML  →  omnigent Omnigent translator
          (emits ``MCPServerConfig(transport=\"stdio\", ...)``)
          →  ``ToolManager.start()`` (spawns the MCP subprocess
          via ``mcp.client.stdio.stdio_client`` under the shared
          ``wrap_with_srt`` helper)
          →  openai-agents harness sees the MCP tool
          →  LLM (OpenAI ``gpt-4o-mini``) calls the tool
          →  ``echo: <probe>`` string round-trips back through
          stdio, through the harness, through the Omnigent mode reply
          render, into this test's stdout.

No mocks in the whole chain. The MCP server is
``tests/tools/fixtures/echo_stdio_mcp_server.py`` (a FastMCP
subprocess this test spawns at run time); the LLM is OpenAI's
real ``gpt-4o-mini`` endpoint reached via ``$OPENAI_API_KEY``.

**What breaks if this fails:**

- The Omnigent translator silently drops the
  :class:`~omnigent.inner.tools.MCPTool`: the spec loads, but
  the omnigent runtime never registers the tool, the LLM
  never calls it, and the ``echo: <probe>`` fingerprint is
  absent. The unit test
  (``test_omnigent_adapter.py::test_load_mcp_stdio_yaml_
  translates_to_mcp_server``) asserts the translator emits the
  right ``MCPServerConfig``, but doesn't exercise the
  subprocess side.
- ``McpServerConnection._open_stdio_transport`` regresses so
  the subprocess never spawns or the stdio handshake hangs —
  the unit tests patch ``stdio_client``, only this test runs
  the real one against a real FastMCP server.
- ``wrap_with_srt`` mis-wraps on this host's configuration
  (srt present but a runtime path rule denies the subprocess
  from exec'ing ``python``): the unit tests cover the wrap's
  branching truth table but can't catch host-environment
  interactions.

The test is skipped cleanly when ``OPENAI_API_KEY`` is absent
so CI / other developers aren't blocked.

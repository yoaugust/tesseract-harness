"""Live concurrency + process-lifecycle e2e for the antigravity (Gemini) harness.

The ``antigravity`` harness drives Google's Antigravity Python SDK
(``google-antigravity``). Unlike the other SDK harnesses it is **not**
pure-Python: ``Agent.__aenter__`` opens a local connection that spawns a
bundled **native ``localharness`` binary** (~111 MB ELF) which talks to
Google's Gemini backend. This test file is the lifecycle/concurrency counterpart
to the one-shot per-harness gates (``test_per_harness_claude_sdk.py`` /
``test_per_harness_cursor.py``): it drives real ``omnigent run`` subprocesses
and asserts invariants about *concurrent* turns and the *native subprocess
lifecycle* rather than a single assistant reply.

Three properties are covered, all against STABLE-on-main behavior:

1. **Parallel turns / no state bleed** — two concurrent ``omnigent run``
   invocations, each a distinct ephemeral session (``--no-session``) carrying a
   distinct sentinel token in its prompt. Each session's transcript must contain
   ONLY its own sentinel — proving the per-session SDK ``Agent``/``Conversation``
   reuse (keyed by ``session_key`` in
   :class:`~omnigent.inner.antigravity_executor.AntigravityExecutor`) does not
   leak one conversation's content into another's.
2. **No orphaned ``localharness``** — snapshot the live ``localharness`` PIDs
   before a turn and again after it ends cleanly; the turn must not leave a NEW
   native subprocess behind (the SDK ``Agent`` is closed on session teardown via
   ``close_session`` / ``close`` → ``Agent.__aexit__``, which must reap the
   native binary).
3. **Session cleanup reaps the runner/harness** — after a single ``omnigent
   run`` turn's process tree exits, no native subprocess that this run started
   may linger.

**Prerequisites (skipped when absent), mirroring the cursor gate:**

- ``google-antigravity`` importable in the *omnigent* venv (the test shells
  out, so the subprocess interpreter is what matters, not the test's own).
- A Gemini API key resolvable — either a configured ``antigravity:`` block
  (``omnigent setup``) or an ambient ``GEMINI_API_KEY`` / ``ANTIGRAVITY_API_KEY``.
  Antigravity is Gemini-native (no Databricks gateway / ``base_url`` path), so
  unlike the gateway harnesses this test does NOT use ``patched_databrickscfg``
  / ``omnigent_credentials_env`` — a missing key is a clean SKIP so the e2e
  shards stay green, and it runs for real wherever a key is present.

**Why this test cannot use the mock LLM server:** The ``google-antigravity``
SDK has no OpenAI-compatible ``base_url`` and no Databricks-gateway path.
Setting ``OPENAI_BASE_URL`` to the mock server has no effect on this harness —
the SDK always connects directly to Google's Gemini backend. Furthermore,
assertions 2 and 3 verify the lifecycle of a real native ``localharness``
binary process; a mock LLM could not exercise this at all. The ``pytest.skip``
in the :func:`antigravity_runnable` fixture gates cleanly when the SDK or key
is absent.

.. note::
   **glibc >= ~2.36 caveat.** The native ``localharness`` binary is linked
   against a recent glibc (needs ``GLIBC_ABI_DT_RELR``). On an older host (e.g.
   glibc 2.31) a live turn fails at SDK setup with ``RuntimeError: …
   localharness: … version 'GLIBC_ABI_DT_RELR' not found``, surfaced as an
   ``ExecutorError``. There is a dev-only loader-shim workaround
   (``ANTIGRAVITY_HARNESS_PATH`` pointing at a newer glibc's loader), but this
   test never depends on it: the lifecycle assertions (2, 3) hold even when the
   turn fails at setup (the subprocess still tears its process tree down), and
   the no-state-bleed assertion (1) self-skips when neither run produces its
   sentinel (which is what a glibc/quota failure looks like) rather than
   asserting a cross-contamination invariant it cannot observe.

**What breaks if this fails (with prerequisites present):**

- :class:`AntigravityExecutor`'s per-session agent isolation regresses and one
  conversation's state bleeds into another (assertion 1).
- The SDK ``Agent`` teardown (``close_session`` / ``close`` →
  ``_close_agent`` → ``Agent.__aexit__``) stops reaping the native
  ``localharness`` subprocess, leaking a process per turn (assertions 2, 3).
- The ``omnigent run`` one-shot path stops tearing down its local server /
  runner / harness process tree on exit.

    server → runner → native ``localharness``). Once the CLI process exits, that
    tree must be torn down: no ``localharness`` PID this run created may survive.
    Asserts on the before/after PID set difference (robust to unrelated host
    processes) after polling for an async teardown.

    Note (deliberately the *weaker, true* invariant): a separate bug-bash found
    a "session DELETE leaves the runner alive" leak, but it reproduces on the
    claude-sdk harness too — i.e. it is shared session-infra behavior, not an
    antigravity-specific contract. This test therefore does NOT exercise an
    explicit ``DELETE /v1/sessions/{id}`` and assert reaping (which would be a
    known shared-infra failure). It asserts the antigravity-relevant invariant
    that is true on main: a *clean turn end* (the ``-p`` one-shot exiting)
    returns the native-subprocess set to baseline. The CLI process exiting 0 is
    the clean-turn-end signal; the PID-diff is the reaping check.

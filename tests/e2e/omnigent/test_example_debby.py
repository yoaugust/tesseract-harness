"""Structural test for the Debby two-headed brainstorming bundle (examples/debby).

Debby never answers from a single model: every question is fanned out to BOTH a
Claude sub-agent and a GPT sub-agent — two plain (non-coding) responders on the
claude-sdk and codex harnesses — and the ``debate`` skill has them
critique each other before converging. Pure spec-load — no LLM, no credentials —
modeled on ``test_example_polly.py``.

What breaks if this fails:
- the two heads collapse onto one vendor (no cross-model contrast — Debby's whole
  point), or a head is dropped entirely,
- a head silently switches harness (e.g. the GPT head ends up on claude-sdk),
- the ``debate`` skill is dropped or renamed (the critique loop regresses),
- the ``os_env`` block disappears (the heads lose the file/shell tools the
  brainstorming surface relies on).

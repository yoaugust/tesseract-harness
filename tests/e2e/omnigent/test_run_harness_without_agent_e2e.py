"""Live REPL e2e for ``omnigent run --harness`` without AGENT.

Migrated to use the mock LLM server. This test drives the user-facing
launcher shape::

    omnigent run --harness <harness> -p <prompt>

under a real pseudo-TTY against the mock LLM server. It waits for the
REPL banner, lets the ``-p`` startup hook submit a real user turn, and
asserts the mock model returns the expected marker. No real Databricks
credentials are required.

def test_run_harness_live_matrix_covers_registered_coding_harnesses() -> None:
    """The live no-AGENT e2e matrix tracks REPL-launchable harnesses.

    ``OMNIGENT_HARNESSES`` also contains ``open-responses`` for the
    legacy in-process executor path, but that harness is not currently
    registered in the server-backed REPL harness registry. This test
    makes the distinction explicit: when a coding harness is added to
    ``_HARNESS_MODULES``, this file must gain a live round-trip row
    for it.

    ``claude-native``, ``codex-native``, ``pi-native``, and
    ``opencode-native`` are excluded because their inner executors require
    bridge directories plus runner-managed terminal panes to inject keys
    into — both set up by their native launchers, not by
    ``omnigent run --harness <native>``. (``opencode-native`` is a
    terminal-takeover ``native-server`` harness, the same shape as the
    other natives.) Running them through this matrix would hang or crash.
    Their e2e coverage is via native launcher smoke tests (tracked
    separately as native-launcher PTY/REPL smoke tests).

    ``cursor`` is excluded because this matrix authenticates through
    the Databricks gateway/profile, while cursor-agent talks only to
    Cursor's own backend and rejects gateway model ids.

    ``antigravity`` is excluded for the same reason as ``cursor``: it is
    Gemini-native and its SDK launches a native binary needing a modern
    glibc.

    ``copilot`` is excluded for the same reason as ``cursor`` / ``antigravity``:
    the GitHub Copilot SDK authenticates with a GitHub token and talks only to
    GitHub's Copilot backend (no Databricks gateway path), so ``_build_copilot_spawn_env``
    emits none of the shared ``HARNESS_<H>_GATEWAY`` / profile probe vars this
    matrix drives. Its live round-trip is covered by the gated
    ``tests/e2e/test_polly_copilot_e2e.py`` and the ``copilot-sdk-e2e-dev`` skill.

    ``cursor-native`` is excluded for the union of both reasons above.

    ``qwen`` is excluded because it does not follow the shared
    ``HARNESS_<HARNESS>_GATEWAY``/``DATABRICKS_PROFILE`` probe wiring that
    this matrix (and ``test_harness_wrap_e2e.py``) drive harnesses with: its
    wrap routes through ``HARNESS_QWEN_GATEWAY_BASE_URL`` /
    ``HARNESS_QWEN_GATEWAY_AUTH_COMMAND`` instead. Its live round-trip is
    covered by the dedicated ``test_per_harness_qwen.py`` suite.

    ``goose`` (headless ACP) is excluded for the same reason as ``qwen``: it
    authenticates from Goose's own config (``goose configure``), not the shared
    gateway/profile probe wiring, so ``_build_goose_spawn_env`` emits no
    ``HARNESS_GOOSE_GATEWAY*`` vars for this matrix to drive. Its live round-trip
    is covered by the dedicated ``test_goose_acp_e2e.py`` suite.

    ``acp`` (the generic ACP harness) is excluded because it has no fixed binary
    or command of its own — it drives whatever ACP-agent command the user
    registers in the ``acp:`` config block, so there is nothing for this
    binary-less no-agent matrix to probe.

    ``goose-native`` is excluded for the same reason as ``claude-native`` /
    ``cursor-native``: it is a terminal-first TUI launched via ``omni goose``
    (tmux pane + bridge dir), not ``omnigent run --harness goose-native``.

    ``antigravity-native`` is excluded for the union of both reasons above: it
    is a terminal-first TUI launched via ``omnigent antigravity`` (runner-owned
    agy tmux pane + bridge dir), not ``omnigent run --harness antigravity-native``,
    AND it is Gemini-native (agy authenticates via Google OAuth, not the shared
    Databricks gateway/profile probe wiring this matrix drives).

    ``qwen-native`` is excluded for the same reason as ``goose-native`` /
    ``cursor-native``: it is a terminal-first TUI launched via ``omni qwen``
    (tmux pane + bridge dir, driving qwen's ``--input-file`` / ``--json-file``),
    not ``omnigent run --harness qwen-native``. Its coverage is the dedicated
    qwen-native bridge/executor/forwarder unit tests.

    ``kiro-native`` is excluded for the same reason as ``goose-native`` /
    ``qwen-native`` / ``cursor-native``: it is a terminal-first TUI launched via
    ``omni kiro`` (tmux pane + bridge dir), not ``omnigent run --harness
    kiro-native``. Its coverage is the dedicated kiro-native bridge/executor/
    forwarder unit tests plus the ``test_native_kiro_render_parity`` e2e_ui suite.

    ``kimi`` is excluded for the same reason as ``hermes``: it requires the
    ``kimi`` CLI binary (installed via Moonshot's curl installer) and
    authenticates through ``kimi login`` (OAuth or a Moonshot API key), not the
    shared Databricks gateway/profile probe wiring this matrix drives.

    ``kimi-native`` is excluded for the same reason as ``goose-native`` /
    ``qwen-native`` / ``kiro-native``: it is a terminal-first TUI launched via
    ``omni kimi`` (tmux pane + bridge dir), not ``omnigent run --harness
    kimi-native``. Its coverage is the dedicated kimi-native bridge/executor/
    forwarder/approval unit tests plus the Kimi picker e2e_ui suite.

    ``hermes`` is excluded because it requires the ``hermes`` CLI binary
    (installed separately via Nous Research's install script) and authenticates
    through its own provider config, not the shared gateway/profile probe
    wiring this matrix drives.

    ``hermes-native`` is excluded for the union of both reasons: it is a
    terminal-first TUI launched via ``omni hermes`` (tmux pane + bridge dir), not
    ``omnigent run --harness hermes-native``, AND it wraps the ``hermes`` CLI
    binary. Its coverage is the dedicated hermes-native bridge/executor/forwarder/
    approval-mirror unit tests.

    Builtin ACP CLI harnesses (every row of ``ACP_CLI_HARNESSES``) are excluded
    for the same reason as ``goose``: each wraps an own-auth vendor CLI, so its
    spawn env carries no gateway/profile probe vars for this matrix to drive.
    Their shared wiring is covered by ``tests/test_acp_cli_harnesses.py`` and
    the ``tests/inner/test_acp_executor.py`` suite.

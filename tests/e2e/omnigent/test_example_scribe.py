"""Structural test for the Scribe documentation bundle (examples/scribe).

Scribe is the docs counterpart to Polly: it authors prose itself and delegates
read-only code investigation to a ``researcher`` sub-agent (claude-sdk), with an
optional cross-vendor fact-check by a ``reviewer`` sub-agent (codex). Pure
spec-load — no LLM, no credentials — modeled on ``test_example_debby.py``.

What breaks if this fails:
- a sub-agent is dropped or renamed (Scribe loses investigation or the
  fact-check),
- the reviewer collapses onto claude-sdk (the cross-model fact-check stops being
  independent),
- a sub-agent silently pins a model (re-coupling it to one provider — a
  Databricks-only id would 404 on a plain Anthropic / OpenAI key),
- a doc skill (changelog / migration-guide / api-docs) is dropped or renamed,
- the ``os_env`` block disappears (Scribe loses the file/shell tools it reads
  context and writes docs with).

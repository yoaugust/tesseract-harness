"""
End-to-end: omnigent example YAMLs that declare unsupported
concepts MUST fail loud at spec-load time under Omnigent mode.

The adapter in :mod:`omnigent.spec.omnigent` rejects several
concepts it cannot faithfully translate into an omnigent
:class:`AgentSpec` (see
:func:`_reject_unsupported_concepts_def`):

- ``policies`` — label-based + function-type policies have no
  omnigent parity yet.
- MCP-type tools — omnigent' subprocess MCP transport has no
  omnigent equivalent (omnigent uses HTTP/SSE MCP only).

Silent translation of these would give the user an agent that
LOOKS configured (no error at boot) but lacks the policies /
tools the YAML promised — a foot-gun. The right behavior is
``omnigent run <yaml>`` exits non-zero with an error
message naming the specific field.

This test parametrizes over every example YAML that trips at
least one rejection, and asserts:

1. Exit code is non-zero.
2. stderr contains the expected field name (``"guardrails.policies"``
   or ``"mcp_servers"``).

**What breaks if this test fails:**

- :func:`_reject_unsupported_concepts_def` silently drops one
  of these concepts — a YAML author declares a policy, gets an
  unpoliced agent, security-relevant behavior is silently
  missing.
- The CLI's error-propagation path swallows the adapter's
  :class:`OmnigentError` and exits 0.
- Someone adds translation support for one of these concepts
  but forgets to remove its entry here.

# (yaml_relpath, expected_error_substring, id)
#
# The rejection surface in :func:`_reject_unsupported_concepts`
# has shrunk over time as the Omnigent translator has grown:
#
# - **Policies**: lifted into ``AgentSpec.guardrails.policies``
#   and enforced by the workflow layer (see
#   ``test_run_omnigent_policy_enforcement.py``). No longer rejected.
# - **MCP servers / tools**: the stdio MCP transport landed in
#   commit a081406 ("stdio MCP: finish the round-trip");
#   :class:`MCPServerConfig` round-trips through the reverse
#   translator as :class:`MCPTool`. No longer rejected.
# - **`tools.sandbox.container_image`**: still rejected, but no
#   example YAML in the repo declares it, so there's nothing to
#   parametrize over today. The drift-guard intent (a yaml
#   author silently loses sandbox isolation) survives in the
#   adapter's :func:`_reject_unsupported_concepts` and its unit
#   tests; this e2e file is a no-op until a YAML lands that
#   exercises the surviving rejection path.
#
# Empty parametrize → pytest collects zero test instances. The
# scaffolding stays so a future case (when a new "still
# unsupported" concept lands) can be added without re-deriving
# the subprocess invocation pattern.

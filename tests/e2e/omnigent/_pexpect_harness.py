"""Reusable pexpect helpers for driving the Omnigent REPL.

The Omnigent REPL is a prompt-toolkit app that renders a full
terminal layout (status bar + input area + streaming output +
Ctrl+G debug overview). Driving it from tests requires:

1. A PTY-backed subprocess (``pexpect.spawn``) with a real
   ``TERM`` so prompt-toolkit draws its layout instead of
   erroring out on CPR probes.
2. Deterministic synchronization — the status bar text
   (``state: sleeping`` / ``state: running``) is the most stable
   turn-boundary signal because it's printed on every redraw.
3. Keystroke-level input — ``pexpect.sendline`` sends
   ``\\r\\n`` which prompt-toolkit interprets as two distinct
   Enter presses in some builds; ``send(...) + send("\\r")``
   is what reliably submits a prompt.

The helpers here encapsulate that ceremony so individual tests
stay focused on the behavior they exercise.

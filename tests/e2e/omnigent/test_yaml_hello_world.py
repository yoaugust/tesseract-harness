"""Phase 0 characterization test — YAML-driven agent with tools (mock LLM).

Migrated to mock LLM: uses the session-scoped mock server instead of
a real Databricks gateway.  Parametrized across every wrapped harness
(claude-sdk, codex, pi, openai-agents); rows whose harness CLI binary
is absent are skipped via :func:`skip_if_harness_cli_missing` so CI
still picks up openai-agents without needing the ``claude`` / ``codex``
/ ``pi`` binaries.

**What breaks if this fails:**
- Omnigent' YAML spec parser regresses on ``tools.*`` entries
  (``function`` / ``cancellable_function`` types).
- The wrapped harness loses its MCP tool bridging or its
  prompt-construction path.
- Per-YAML defaults fail to pick up the ``callable:`` dotted
  paths via ``importlib.import_module`` — the tool never gets
  registered and the agent can't invoke it.
- The YAML→tools round-trip breaks: the forced ``calculate``
  tool_call never executes / its result never returns, so the
  mock's final response (carrying the sentinel) is never reached.
  (Headless ``-p`` does not stream ``◦/• <tool>`` lifecycle lines
  to stdout — see #783 — so the tool is verified via the sentinel,
  not those markers.)

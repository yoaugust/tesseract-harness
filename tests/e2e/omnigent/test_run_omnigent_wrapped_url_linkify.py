"""
End-to-end regression test: CLI terminal links must not be
truncated when URLs wrap across multiple rows.

Journey (what a user does):

1. Run ``omnigent run`` in a terminal (120 columns here — the
   harness default).
2. The agent prints an HTTP(S) URL that is longer than the
   terminal is wide — in its assistant text, and in the
   tool-call summary line for a shell command containing the
   URL.
3. The assistant-text URL wraps onto several terminal rows;
   the tool-call summary is elided with ``…`` at the row edge.
4. The user clicks the URL on its first displayed row.

Expected: every displayed URL fragment points at the FULL
destination (query string and fragment included).

Observed bug: ``linkify_ansi`` runs AFTER the text has been
wrapped/elided for display, so the URL regex only sees the
first-row fragment. The OSC 8 hyperlink emitted for the first
row targets only that fragment (e.g.
``https://host/seg-path/seg-path/…s`` without the query or
fragment), continuation rows carry no hyperlink at all, and
the elided tool-call summary links to a garbage destination
that embeds the ``…`` ellipsis character.

What this test pins that the existing coverage doesn't:

  - ``tests/e2e/omnigent/test_run_omnigent_url_linkify.py``
    proves a SHORT URL (fits on one row) is OSC 8-wrapped
    end-to-end. It never wraps, so it can't see this bug.
  - This test uses URLs longer than the PTY width and asserts
    on the OSC 8 *destination* bytes — the exact URL a
    terminal opens when the user clicks — not merely that some
    envelope exists.

Assertion strategy: collect every OSC 8 opener
(``\\x1b]8;<params>;<target>ST``) in the PTY stream, then:

  - assistant text (streamed lines AND the final Rich
    markdown/replacement render): at least one hyperlink
    pointing at the stream URL's host was emitted, and every
    one of them targets the complete URL;
  - tool-call summary: every hyperlink pointing at the tool
    URL's host (if any — a fix may legitimately stop
    hyperlinking elided summaries) targets the complete URL,
    never a truncated/elided fragment.

On the buggy build both fail with the truncated destinations
reported verbatim; if linkify were removed entirely the
assistant-text check fails on the missing hyperlink.

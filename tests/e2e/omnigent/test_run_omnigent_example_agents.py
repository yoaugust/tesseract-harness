"""
End-to-end: every example YAML the Omnigent adapter is
*expected* to accept can actually boot and execute under
``omnigent run -p <prompt>``.

One parametrized case per YAML. Each case:

1. Skips if a vendor binary the harness needs isn't on PATH
   (``codex``, ``claude``).
2. Runs the example with a carefully-chosen prompt that
   exercises the YAML's declared capabilities (tools, sub-agents,
   os_env, etc.).
3. Asserts exit 0 and at least one content fingerprint in stdout.

The companion file
``test_run_omnigent_adapter_rejections.py`` covers YAMLs the adapter
rejects on purpose. The two together enumerate every example.

**What breaks if a case here fails:**

- The adapter stops translating a previously-working concept
  (os_env, inline AgentTool, cancellable_function, etc.).
- The Omnigent mode CLI shim loses a dispatch for a harness.
- A new dependency lands in the example YAML (e.g. the example
  starts requiring a binary the CI box doesn't have) — then the
  skip rule needs widening.

Failures that aren't regressions (e.g. external network flakes,
LLM nondeterminism) are tracked in ``TODO_omnigent_coverage.md`` in
this directory so the test suite doesn't accumulate silent
xfails.

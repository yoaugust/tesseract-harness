"""Drift guard: every agent — dir-shaped ``examples/<name>/`` or
``tests/resources/examples/<name>/`` (containing ``config.yaml``),
single-YAML ``examples/<name>.yaml`` or
``tests/resources/examples/<name>.yaml``, or test-only
``tests/resources/agents/<name>/`` — must have a dedicated
``test_example_<name>.py`` file under ``tests/e2e/omnigent/``.

The set of agent roots scanned here is kept in lock-step with the
resolution order in
``tests/e2e/omnigent/_example_helpers.py::example_yaml_path`` — the
helper the per-example tests use to find their YAML. If the guard
scans fewer roots than the helper resolves, a ``test_example_*.py``
that points at a real agent in the un-scanned root looks "orphaned"
to the guard even though it runs fine. (That exact skew —
``tests/resources/examples/`` being resolvable by the helper but
invisible to the guard — is what this file historically tripped on.)

When a new agent lands in any of those roots, the author should
add a test file in the same commit. This test fails loud if an
agent ships without one, and loud again if a test file points
at an agent that no longer exists.

Not a functional test — just a structural cross-check so the
coverage-per-agent rule can't silently drift.

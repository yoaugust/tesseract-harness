"""Structural test for the polly coding-orchestrator bundle (examples/polly).

polly is the standalone multi-agent coding orchestrator (successor to the
deleted nessie example, whose deep structural pins were folded in here).
Loads the bundle and asserts the distinctive wiring stays intact: the
claude-sdk orchestrator brain, the seven cross-vendor coding sub-agents
(claude_code / codex / opencode / cursor / hermes / agy / pi, which implement,
review, and explore),
the three spine skills, and the bounds/blast-radius guardrails. Pure spec-load
— no LLM, no credentials.

What breaks if this fails:
- the orchestrator substrate drifts (model / harness / context window),
- a coding sub-agent is dropped or its harness changes (no implementers, or
  two collapse onto one vendor → cross-vendor review blind spot),
- a spine skill is dropped or renamed (the strategy layer regresses),
- a guardrail is removed (unbounded fan-out, or ungated push/deploy).

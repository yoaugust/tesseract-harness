"""E2E coverage for the ``omnigent host`` Ctrl+C stop-server prompt.

``omnigent host ""`` (local mode) spawns a *detached* background local
AP server (:func:`omnigent.host.local_server.ensure_local_omnigent_server`) that
intentionally outlives the foreground host daemon so sessions and the Web
UI stay reachable across ``host`` / ``run``. Because users expect Ctrl+C
to stop "everything", the connect command now prompts on a clean stop:

    Stop it too? [y/N]

These tests drive the real CLI under a PTY, send a real SIGINT (Ctrl+C),
and verify the branches against the *actual* server process:

1. Answering ``y`` stops the detached server — its ``/health`` endpoint
   stops responding.
2. Answering ``n`` leaves the server running — ``/health`` still answers
   200 after the host process has exited. The test then stops the
   stranded server itself so it does not leak past the test.
3. When connect *reuses* a server it did not spawn (one already brought up
   by a prior daemon, via the real ``ensure_local_omnigent_server`` path), Ctrl+C
   shows NO prompt and leaves that server running — connect must never
   offer to stop a server it didn't start.

The detached server is the genuine production object (a real ``omnigent
server`` subprocess), so these tests fail loudly if the prompt is dropped,
wired to the wrong default, fires for a reused server, or if ``y`` fails to
actually terminate the server — none of which a mock-based test would catch.

"""Phase 0 characterization test — REPL smoke under pexpect.

Spawns ``omnigent run <yaml>`` under a PTY, waits for the
REPL's ``❯`` input prompt, types a prompt, awaits the turn
completion, then exits cleanly via Ctrl+D. Proves the REPL's
basic input/output pipeline works end-to-end. The full
key-binding / overview / interrupt matrix lands in follow-ups
per the design doc.

Synchronization contract (post REPL UI refactor): the turn is
driven off the visible ``⠹ working`` activity line and the
``❯`` input prompt that re-renders when the turn settles —
the same markers the green Ctrl+R / ``/model`` e2e tests use.
The old bottom-right ``state: running``/``state: sleeping``
badge is no longer a reliable pexpect signal: it sits at the
far edge of the toolbar and is truncated/CPR-suppressed under
a PTY. Likewise the user/assistant turns now render as a ``❯``
echo and a ``◆ <model>`` header — the legacy ``You>`` / ``Agent>``
banners were removed in the prompt-toolkit rewrite.

**What breaks if this fails:**
- ``omnigent.cli._run_agent`` REPL entrypoint stops booting
  under a PTY (prompt-toolkit layout errors, terminal-type
  handling regression).
- The REPL stops echoing the submitted prompt with its ``❯``
  marker — the submission never reached the Session.
- ``Session.stream_turn`` stops actually producing events
  when driven from the REPL (turn never returns to the idle
  ``❯`` prompt).
- Ctrl+D stops terminating the REPL cleanly (either hangs the
  subprocess or crashes on shutdown).

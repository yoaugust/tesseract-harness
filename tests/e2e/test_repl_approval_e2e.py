REPL approval-flow e2e test.

Spawns ``omnigent chat examples/agents/ask-demo/`` as a subprocess
under a pseudo-TTY (pexpect), feeds real input, and asserts
the agent responds after the user approves a policy ASK.
This exercises the full Phase 10 path — prompt_toolkit's
real input loop, the SSE stream consuming ``ElicitationRequest``
events, the REPL's future-based approval wiring, and the
server PATCHing the verdict back through the durable
session workflow.

Unlike ``test_policies_e2e.py`` (polling API, background=True),
this test drives the REPL through the actual streaming code
path — the code path a human types into at the terminal.

All 14 tests run against the mock LLM server: ``OPENAI_BASE_URL``
is injected into the REPL subprocess's environment so the inner
OpenAI harness routes to the mock server. Each test pre-configures
the mock's keyed response queue before spawning the subprocess.

Prerequisites:
    - ``pexpect`` installed (4.9+).
    - ``ap`` on ``PATH`` resolving to this worktree's entry
      point (set ``PYTHONPATH`` so the editable install from
      a sibling worktree doesn't shadow it).

Usage::

    python -m pytest tests/e2e/test_repl_approval_e2e.py -v --timeout=180

    Redirects ``HOME`` to a temp dir seeded with
    ``.omnigent/config.yaml`` so the spawned interactive REPL starts
    cleanly under pexpect:

    - ``tui.theme`` is persisted, so the REPL's first-launch theme
      picker (``_repl._load_startup_theme`` → ``startup_theme_picker``,
      which reads ``$HOME/.omnigent/config.yaml`` — NOT
      ``OMNIGENT_CONFIG_HOME``) is skipped. Under pexpect's pty stdin
      is a tty, so without a persisted theme the arrow-key picker blocks
      and the welcome banner never appears (the CI failure, where
      ``$HOME`` is fresh).
    - ``auto_open_conversation: false`` stops the interactive REPL from
      opening a browser tab per run (``--no-open`` is not a valid
      ``run`` flag; config is the supported path). ``OMNIGENT_CONFIG_HOME``
      points at the same dir so the CLI reads it too.

    Because ``HOME`` is redirected, ``DATABRICKS_CONFIG_FILE`` is pinned
    to the real ``~/.databrickscfg`` so ``--profile`` lookups still
    resolve, and ``OMNIGENT_SKIP_ONBOARD`` guards against any other
    first-run prompt (these tests exercise REPL approval, not onboarding).

# ── Sub-agent TOOL_CALL approval (non-interactive) ─────────

    Sub-agent TOOL_CALL ASK does NOT tunnel a banner to the root REPL.

    This asserts the CURRENT behavior, not the aspirational tunneled
    interactive approval (tracked by #765). The fixture's
    ``toolworker`` sub-agent has a LOCAL function tool ``echo`` and a
    ``worker_tool_gate`` policy that ASKs on ``tool_call:echo``.

    Observed reality (captured live against the mock LLM): the parent
    spawns ``toolworker`` via ``sys_session_send``; the headless
    sub-agent's ``echo`` TOOL_CALL ASK does NOT park for a
    root-surfaced prompt — the sub-agent runs ``echo`` to completion,
    its reply lands in the parent's inbox, and the parent composes its
    final summary. The turn finishes with no banner or human
    interaction.

    Load-bearing assertions:

    - The sub-agent's nested local ``echo`` tool registers with the
      spawned child's executor — the call does NOT error
      ``Tool echo not found`` (the regression in #763).
    - NO ``approval required`` banner surfaces on the root REPL.
    - The parent's final summary renders, proving the sub-agent ran
      end-to-end (echo executed) despite the unprompted TOOL_CALL ASK.

    The parent (``model: gpt-4o``) and the sub-agent
    (``model: gpt-4o-mini``) draw from separate keyed mock queues so
    each agent's scripted calls land deterministically — a single
    shared queue races the parent's continuation call against the
    sub-agent's ``echo`` call (the parent would consume the
    sub-agent's tool call and error ``Tool echo not found``).

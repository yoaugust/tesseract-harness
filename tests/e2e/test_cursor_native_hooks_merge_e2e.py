"""End-to-end regression test: ``omnigent cursor`` must merge ``.cursor/hooks.json``.

Guards the regression where launching the cursor-native harness in a workspace
that already carries a project-scoped ``.cursor/hooks.json`` (e.g. Universe's
``preToolUse`` policy hook) fully replaced that file with Omnigent's
session-specific ``stop`` usage hook, destroying the user's existing hooks.
The destructive write happens during the runner-side terminal launch
(``write_hooks_config`` in :mod:`omnigent.harnesses.cursor_native.bridge`, called from
``omnigent/runner/native/orchestration.py``) — *before* the cursor executable
is resolved and before any model turn.

Because the failure fires at launch, this test — unlike the sibling
``test_cursor_native_cli_e2e`` — needs NO authenticated ``cursor-agent`` and
no real model turn: an unauthenticated TUI sitting at its login prompt is
enough, since the hooks.json rewrite strictly precedes the tmux launch. It
therefore gates only on the ``cursor-agent`` and ``tmux`` binaries, not on
``OMNIGENT_E2E_CURSOR_NATIVE``.

The journey it drives is exactly the user's:

1. a workspace already has ``.cursor/hooks.json`` with a ``preToolUse`` hook;
2. the user launches ``omnigent cursor`` from that workspace;
3. after the cursor terminal comes up, ``.cursor/hooks.json`` must still
   contain the pre-existing ``preToolUse`` hook alongside Omnigent's ``stop``
   usage hook. A launch path that clobbers the file wholesale instead of
   merging fails the final assertion.

"""E2E: cursor-native must validate the bridge-dir ancestor chain before writing the relay token.

``cursor-native`` keeps its per-session bridge tree under
``$TMPDIR/omnigent-<uid>/cursor-native/<digest>/``. At terminal launch the
runner calls :func:`omnigent.harnesses.cursor_native.bridge.write_mcp_config`, which
routes through :func:`write_mcp_bridge_config` to write ``bridge.json`` — the
bearer token for the Omnigent MCP relay's localhost control endpoint.

On a multi-user POSIX host an attacker can pre-create an ancestor of that tree
(``$TMPDIR/omnigent-<uid>``) as a symlink or a group/other-writable directory.
The token write must then fail loudly (or repair an owned-but-permissive dir to
owner-only) instead of landing the token in a directory chain the user does not
exclusively control — exactly what ``qwen-native`` already does by routing the
write through ``claude_native_bridge._ensure_secure_dir``.

Each scenario runs in a **fresh Python subprocess** with a hostile ``TMPDIR``
staged before interpreter start, so ``cursor_native_bridge._BRIDGE_ROOT`` is
computed from the environment exactly as in a real runner process — no
monkeypatching of the module under test.

"""End-to-end tests: ``omnigent goose`` drives the native Goose TUI.

The goose-native sibling of ``test_cursor_native_cli_e2e``. ``goose-native`` is a
*terminal-first* harness: ``omnigent goose`` launches Block's ``goose session``
TUI in a runner-owned tmux pane, and each web-UI turn is injected into that pane
(bracketed paste + Enter) by
:class:`omnigent.inner.goose_native_executor.GooseNativeExecutor`. The TUI's own
SQLite session store is tailed by :mod:`omnigent.harnesses.goose_native.forwarder`, which
mirrors Goose's replies back onto the Omnigent conversation as assistant items.

These tests drive the full stack the way a user does — spawn ``omnigent goose``,
then talk to the session **through the server** (``POST /v1/sessions/{id}/events``,
the web-UI path) — and assert on the persisted assistant items.

Environment requirements (why this is opt-in, not pure-CI)
----------------------------------------------------------
* **Opt-in only**: set ``OMNIGENT_E2E_GOOSE_NATIVE=1`` to run. Like the other
  native-TUI e2e tests, goose-native needs a configured Goose provider (via
  ``goose configure`` or ``GOOSE_PROVIDER``/``GOOSE_MODEL`` + a provider key in
  the environment) and a ``tmux`` binary; the ``goose`` binary may be present on
  CI but unconfigured, which would error the TUI. The env-var gate keeps it out
  of CI; a developer with a configured Goose opts in. ``tmux`` and ``goose`` on
  ``PATH`` are also required (checked below).
* ``GOOSE_MODE=auto`` is recommended in the test environment so the cwd test's
  file-read tool call is not blocked on an in-terminal approval prompt.

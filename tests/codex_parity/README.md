# Codex Parity Tests

This suite verifies Omnigent's Codex integration by running the real boundary
we care about:

```text
Omnigent CodexExecutor
  -> real codex app-server process
  -> mock OpenAI Responses API
```

The important choice is that the tests do not mock the Omnigent-to-Codex API.
They start a real Codex CLI and only replace the upstream model endpoint. That
means the test covers Codex app-server JSON-RPC behavior, Codex request
serialization, retry notifications, streaming notifications, and dynamic tool
round trips.

## Architecture

```text
pytest
  |
  | starts
  v
Rust sidecar: tests/codex_parity/sidecar
  |
  | uses upstream Codex test helper crate
  v
core_test_support::responses / WireMock
  ^
  | /v1/responses
  |
real codex app-server
  ^
  | JSON-RPC app-server protocol
  |
Omnigent CodexExecutor
```

The Rust sidecar exists because Codex's mock Responses API helpers are Rust
test-support code in the public Codex repository. Rather than reimplementing
that mock in Python, the sidecar pulls the upstream test-support crate directly
through Cargo:

```text
core_test_support = { git = "https://github.com/openai/codex.git", rev = "..." }
```

That keeps the fake Responses wire format aligned with Codex upstream. Pytest
still owns the test scenarios and assertions; the sidecar only starts WireMock,
serves queued SSE fixtures, and reports captured requests.

The revision is pinned in `tests/codex_parity/sidecar/Cargo.toml` so the parity
harness is reproducible without requiring a checked-in Codex submodule. Updating
the upstream fixture implementation is a normal Cargo dependency bump: change the
Codex `rev`, refresh `Cargo.lock`, and run the parity tests.

## Fixture Flow

Each test passes a list of model responses to the sidecar:

```python
sidecar = codex_responses_sidecar(
    [
        [
            ev_response_created("resp-1"),
            ev_assistant_message("msg-1", "hello"),
            ev_completed("resp-1"),
        ]
    ]
)
```

Each inner list becomes one SSE response body. Codex consumes one body per
`POST /v1/responses` request. Multi-turn scenarios enqueue multiple inner
lists, for example a dynamic tool call followed by the assistant's final
answer after Omnigent returns the tool result.

The sidecar prints one JSON `ready` line with a `base_url`. The pytest fixture
passes that URL into `CodexExecutor` using the existing gateway override path,
so Codex sends model traffic to the sidecar instead of OpenAI.

After a turn, pytest asks the sidecar for captured requests over a small JSONL
stdin/stdout protocol:

```json
{"op": "requests", "min": 1, "timeout_ms": 5000}
```

The response includes stable fields that are useful for parity assertions:
request path, selected headers, and JSON body.

## Coverage

`test_codex_executor_parity.py` covers executor-observable turn behavior:

- `sdk/python/tests/test_app_server_run.py`
  - mock Responses request path/model/input
  - explicit token usage crossing the app-server boundary
  - last unknown-phase message selection
  - final-answer phase preference
  - commentary-only output not becoming the final response
  - failed Responses events surfacing as turn errors
- `sdk/python/tests/test_app_server_streaming.py`
  - text delta routing and completed-turn response
- selected request-routing behavior from `codex-rs/core/tests/suite/*`
  - dynamic tool call/result round trip through real Codex app-server

`test_codex_goal.py` covers the Codex goal contract Omnigent relies on:

- upstream app-server goal operations
  - `thread/goal/set` + `thread/goal/get` + `thread/goal/clear` round trip
  - pause/resume through `thread/goal/set` status-only updates
  - explicit `tokenBudget: null` preservation
  - idempotent `thread/goal/clear`
  - `budgetLimited` preservation when setting the same objective
  - persisted `blocked` and `usageLimited` goal statuses
- Omnigent AP goal routes
  - `PUT /v1/sessions/{id}/codex_goal` forwards objective, budget, and mode
  - `PATCH /v1/sessions/{id}/codex_goal/status` forwards pause/resume
  - Codex-owned terminal statuses are rejected as user-writeable inputs
  - Codex-owned terminal statuses returned by the runner are preserved
  - API-shaped misses return JSON 404s instead of the SPA shell

That is comprehensive for the goal surface Omnigent owns because it exercises
both sides of the integration: real Codex app-server JSON-RPC for every
goal state transition we depend on, and Omnigent's public HTTP route mapping
for every browser control we expose. It intentionally does not copy Codex TUI
slash-menu/status rendering tests; Omnigent does not embed that TUI path. It
also does not duplicate Codex's internal goal-extension accounting tests except
where the app-server result is part of Omnigent's public contract.

Not yet represented here: upstream SDK-only app-server tests for lifecycle,
login, approvals, steer/interrupt, local/remote image input, and skill input.
Those APIs do not have a direct Omnigent `CodexExecutor` surface yet, so they
need either executor-facing analogs or a separate SDK compatibility harness
before they can be one-for-one parity tests.

## Updating From Codex Upstream

The upstream Codex fixture dependency is pinned in
`tests/codex_parity/sidecar/Cargo.toml`:

```toml
core_test_support = { git = "https://github.com/openai/codex.git", rev = "..." }
```

To refresh the harness:

1. Update that `rev` to the Codex commit you want to validate against.
2. Refresh `tests/codex_parity/sidecar/Cargo.lock` by building or testing the
   sidecar.
3. Inspect the pinned Codex checkout under Cargo's git cache, usually
   `~/.cargo/git/checkouts/codex-*/<rev>/`.
4. Compare these upstream files against the local parity files:
   - `sdk/python/tests/test_app_server_run.py`
   - `sdk/python/tests/test_app_server_streaming.py`
   - `sdk/python/tests/test_app_server_goal_operations.py`
   - `sdk/python/tests/test_client_rpc_methods.py`
   - `codex-rs/app-server/tests/suite/v2/thread_resume.rs`
   - `codex-rs/ext/goal/tests/goal_extension_backend.rs`
   - `codex-rs/prompts/src/goals_tests.rs`
5. Port new app-server public-contract goal cases into
   `tests/codex_parity/test_codex_goal.py`. Keep TUI-only cases classified as
   intentionally excluded unless Omnigent starts exposing that path.
6. Run the focused goal file, then the full parity suite:

```bash
pytest tests/codex_parity/test_codex_goal.py \
  --codex-parity \
  --codex-bin "$(which codex)" \
  -q

pytest tests/codex_parity \
  --codex-parity \
  --codex-bin "$(which codex)" \
  -q
```

## Running

Run against the Codex CLI on `PATH`:

```bash
pytest tests/codex_parity --codex-parity -v
```

Run against one explicit binary:

```bash
pytest tests/codex_parity --codex-parity --codex-bin "$(which codex)" -v
```

Compare multiple Codex versions:

```bash
pytest tests/codex_parity \
  --codex-parity \
  --codex-bin /path/to/codex-old \
  --codex-bin /path/to/codex-new \
  -v
```

You can also set `CODEX_TEST_BINS` to an `os.pathsep`-separated list.

At Databricks, use the internal PyPI proxy when syncing the Python test
environment:

```bash
uv --no-config run --frozen \
  --default-index https://pypi-proxy.cloud.databricks.com/simple/ \
  --group test \
  pytest tests/codex_parity --codex-parity --codex-bin "$(which codex)" -q
```

## Why This Shape

Mocking the Omnigent-to-Codex API would test our assumptions about Codex's
app-server protocol. This suite instead lets Codex define that contract by
running the actual CLI/app-server implementation. Only the final network hop is
mocked, which gives us stable, deterministic tests while still catching
protocol drift between Omnigent and Codex.

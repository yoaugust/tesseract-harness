# Harness integration guide

This skill describes the **feature matrix** every Omnigent harness must
consider. Use it when planning, reviewing, or implementing a new harness.

Omnigent has two distinct harness tracks with different architectures and
feature sets:

- **SDK/subprocess harnesses** — run the vendor model directly (in-process SDK,
  CLI subprocess, or ACP subprocess). They own the model lifecycle.
- **Native harnesses** — wrap a vendor's own TUI or server and mirror its
  output into Omnigent. They observe and relay, rather than drive.

---

## Part 1 — SDK / subprocess harnesses

These harnesses run the vendor model directly and bridge Omnigent tools into
the vendor's tool-calling interface.

### Capability matrix

| Capability | What it means |
|---|---|
| **Connects to Omnigent MCP** | Harness exposes/consumes tools via the MCP protocol (in-proc SDK MCP server) |
| **Model override** | User can select a model via `--model` / config; some harnesses are vendor-locked (e.g. Claude-only, GPT-only, Gemini-only) |
| **Auth** | How credentials are obtained — API key, gateway token, vendor CLI login, OAuth, etc. |
| **Streaming** | Harness forwards token-level or delta-level streaming to the Omnigent forwarder |
| **Omnigent policies** | Harness enforces Omnigent-side tool policies — must support ALLOW, ASK, and DENY verdicts for both tool calls and tool results |
| **Native elicitation** | When a policy verdict is ASK, the harness surfaces the approval request in the Omnigent web UI so the user can approve or deny |
| **Interrupt** | User can cancel a running turn mid-stream |
| **Live queue (concurrent)** | Multiple turns can be queued and processed concurrently |
| **Tool-boundary steer** | Omnigent can inject steering text at tool-call boundaries |
| **Resume/fork from Omnigent transcript** | Rebuild a conversation from a stored Omnigent transcript (replay history, seed prompt, or vendor session ID) |
| **Compaction** | Long conversations are compacted; harness surfaces `CompactionComplete` events |
| **Reasoning** | Model reasoning/thinking tokens are forwarded |
| **Images** | Image content (screenshots, diagrams) is forwarded — full binary, path reference, or text-flattened |
| **Cost tracking** | Harness reports token usage and cost data back to Omnigent for each turn |

### MCP connectivity

The harness must bridge Omnigent's builtin MCP tools so the model can call
them. These tools provide session management, agent orchestration, policy
control, and web access:

- `sys_session_get_info`, `sys_session_list`, `sys_session_get_history`
- `sys_agent_get`, `sys_agent_list`, `sys_agent_download`
- `sys_call_async`, `sys_cancel_async`, `sys_cancel_task`
- `sys_read_inbox`
- `sys_add_policy`, `sys_policy_registry`
- `load_skill`
- `list_comments`, `update_comment`
- `web_fetch`, `web_search`

### Omnigent policies

The harness must support the Omnigent policy engine's three verdicts at two
checkpoints:

| Checkpoint | ALLOW | ASK | DENY |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Tool call** (before execution) | Proceed silently | Surface approval request to user (via elicitation) | Block the call and return a policy-denied error to the model |
| **Tool result** (after execution) | Return result to model | Surface result for user review before returning | Suppress the result and return a policy-denied error to the model |

### Native elicitation

When a policy verdict is ASK, the harness must surface the pending tool call
or tool result in the Omnigent web UI as an approval card, then relay the
user's approve/deny decision back to the harness to continue or block
execution.

### Resume / fork strategies

| Strategy | How it works |
|---|---|
| Full history replay | Replays the entire message history into a fresh thread/session |
| History prefix replay | Replays a prefix of the history into a fresh session |
| Text-prefix replay | Injects a text summary/prefix of prior history |
| Prompt seeding | Seeds prior history into the system prompt on rebuild |
| Vendor session ID | Relies on the vendor's own session persistence (no Omnigent-side rebuild) |

### Auth patterns

| Pattern | Description |
|---|---|
| API key / Databricks gateway | Direct API key or routed through a Databricks gateway |
| Vendor API key (direct) | Vendor-specific API key (e.g. Cursor, Gemini) |
| Vendor CLI login / config file | Credentials stored in a vendor config file or managed via vendor CLI login |
| OAuth / GitHub token | OAuth flow or platform token (e.g. GitHub PAT) |
| Gateway + fallback | Primary gateway with fallback to vendor-native auth |

### Checklist for a new SDK/subprocess harness

All capabilities are **required** for a complete harness integration:

- [ ] Connects to Omnigent MCP (in-proc SDK MCP server or vendor-specific bridge)
- [ ] Model override works (or document vendor lock-in)
- [ ] Auth is configured and documented (setup flow in `omni setup`)
- [ ] Streaming forwards to the Omnigent forwarder
- [ ] Omnigent policies enforce tool-use rules
- [ ] Native elicitation surfaces tool-approval requests to web UI
- [ ] Interrupt cancels the running turn
- [ ] Live queue supports concurrent turns
- [ ] Tool-boundary steering injects correctly
- [ ] Resume/fork rebuilds conversation from Omnigent transcript
- [ ] Compaction is surfaced (`CompactionComplete` events)
- [ ] Reasoning tokens are forwarded
- [ ] Images are forwarded (full binary preferred; path or text-flattened acceptable)
- [ ] Cost tracking reports token usage and cost per turn
- [ ] Unit tests cover tool bridging, auth, model routing
- [ ] Mock LLM tests cover the happy path without real API calls

### Shortcut: ACP CLI harnesses are one catalog row

If the vendor CLI speaks the Agent Client Protocol on stdio (the
`goose acp` / `qwen --acp` family), do NOT write a new inner module, registry
entries, or a spawn-env builder. Add one row to `ACP_CLI_HARNESSES` in
`omnigent/acp_cli_harnesses.py` (label, binary, ACP argv, aliases, install
hint or npm package, vendor login command) plus docs. Validity, module
routing, picker label, capabilities, install spec, readiness, setup steps,
spawn env, and the live e2e-matrix exclusion all derive from the row;
`tests/test_acp_cli_harnesses.py` asserts the wiring per row automatically.
These rows run through `omnigent/inner/acp_harness.py` and `AcpExecutor`, own
their auth and model selection, and reject `/model` overrides up front.

---

## Part 2 — Native harnesses

Native harnesses wrap a vendor's own TUI or server and mirror output into
Omnigent. They relay the vendor's conversation into the Omnigent session.

### Capability matrix

| Capability | What it means |
|---|---|
| **Transport** | How the native harness communicates — tmux TUI, app server, HTTP/SSE, file-inject TUI |
| **Connects to Omnigent MCP** | Whether the native harness connects to the Omnigent MCP server |
| **Model override** | User can select a model at launch or per-prompt |
| **Auth** | Vendor login / config / token |
| **Streaming (forwarder)** | `deltas` (token-level) vs `complete-only` (full response after completion) |
| **Omnigent policies** | Whether the native harness enforces Omnigent-side tool policies — must support ALLOW, ASK, and DENY verdicts for both tool calls and tool results |
| **Native elicitation** | When a policy verdict is ASK, the native harness surfaces the approval request in the Omnigent web UI so the user can approve or deny |
| **Interrupt** | User can abort a running turn |
| **Bidirectional sync (TUI->Omni)** | TUI output mirrors into the Omnigent conversation |
| **In-harness session-cmd sync** | Supports `clear`, `fork`, `resume`, `switch` commands from Omnigent |
| **Resume/fork from Omnigent transcript** | Can rebuild conversation from Omnigent transcript (native rebuild, or fresh launch) |
| **Compaction** | Vendor-internal compaction status |
| **Reasoning** | Model reasoning/thinking tokens are forwarded |
| **Images** | Image content is forwarded — path reference, full binary, or text-flattened |
| **Cost tracking** | Native harness reports token usage and cost data back to Omnigent for each turn |
| **Tool-output streaming** | Live incremental command/tool output (`outputDelta`) vs final aggregated output only |
| **Working-tree diff** | The vendor's aggregated per-turn diff is surfaced (vs reconstructed from per-file edits) |
| **Generated/viewed media** | Model-produced or model-viewed images are mirrored (distinct from user-supplied image input) |
| **Vendor modes** | Vendor-specific modes (review mode, plan mode, etc.) are mirrored as status |

### Checklist for a new native harness

Capabilities are tiered by how essential they are. **P0** must work or the
harness is non-functional. **P1** is required for a complete, parity-level
integration — the web surface should match what the vendor TUI shows.
**Stretch** items depend on vendor-specific signals and improve fidelity;
they are optional and may legitimately be closed as wontfix when the vendor
provides no signal or the data is redundant.

**P0 — core (non-functional without these)**

- [ ] Transport chosen and implemented (tmux TUI, app server, HTTP/SSE)
- [ ] Connects to Omnigent MCP
- [ ] Auth configured (vendor login / config)
- [ ] Streaming forwarder works (deltas preferred; complete-only acceptable)
- [ ] Omnigent policies enforce tool-use rules (ALLOW / ASK / DENY at both tool call and tool result)
- [ ] Native elicitation surfaces tool-approval requests to web UI
- [ ] Interrupt aborts the running turn
- [ ] Bidirectional sync mirrors TUI output into Omnigent conversation
- [ ] Cost tracking reports token usage and cost per turn
- [ ] Unit tests cover forwarder, auth, transport
- [ ] Mock LLM tests cover the happy path without real API calls

**P1 — parity (required for a complete integration)**

- [ ] Model override works at launch **and** per-prompt (or document vendor lock-in)
- [ ] Session commands (clear, fork, resume) work from Omnigent
- [ ] Resume/fork rebuilds from Omnigent transcript
- [ ] Reasoning tokens are forwarded
- [ ] Compaction status is surfaced
- [ ] User-supplied images are forwarded (path preferred; binary or text-flattened acceptable)

**Stretch — vendor-dependent fidelity**

- [ ] Live tool/command output is streamed (`outputDelta`), not just final aggregated output
- [ ] The vendor's aggregated working-tree diff is surfaced (if provided)
- [ ] Generated/viewed media (model-produced or model-viewed images) is mirrored
- [ ] Vendor-specific modes (review mode, plan mode, etc.) are mirrored as status

# Omnigent on Railway

Deploy Omnigent to Railway. Railway pulls the pre-built image, runs it next to
a managed Postgres, and serves it over HTTPS on `*.up.railway.app`.

> **Railway is not yet a true one-click.** Unlike Render's `render.yaml` (fully
> declarative — Postgres, port, and env all wired automatically), a bare
> `railway.toml` leaves several things to wire by hand (steps below). A real
> one-click experience needs a **published Railway template** that pre-wires the
> Postgres reference, `HOST`, and target port — tracked as a follow-up. Until
> then, use the manual steps here. (Render is the smoother path today.)

<!-- TODO(oss-release): publish a Railway template (pre-wiring Postgres + HOST +
     port) and add the button:
     [![Deploy on Railway](https://railway.com/button.svg)](https://railway.com/deploy/<template-id>) -->

## What gets provisioned

- **omnigent** — web service that pulls `ghcr.io/omnigent-ai/omnigent-server`
  via `deploy/docker/Dockerfile.prebuilt`, served on `https://<project>.up.railway.app`.
- **Postgres** — Railway-managed PostgreSQL plugin you add to the project.
  Adding the plugin does **not** wire its `DATABASE_URL` into the app on its
  own. You add that reference variable on the omnigent service yourself before
  the app can boot (see step 2).

Artifact storage uses the container's local filesystem by default (ephemeral
across redeploys). For persistence, add a Railway Volume mounted at
`/data/artifacts`.

> **Optional: external Neon Postgres.** Instead of the Railway plugin, you can
> point `DATABASE_URL` at a Neon database ([pg.new](https://pg.new)) — e.g. for
> Neon's serverless scale-to-zero or branching. Tradeoff: you lose the
> integrated provisioning (a separate signup + connection string) and add some
> cross-provider latency, so the Railway plugin stays the simpler default.

## Setup (built-in accounts — the default)

Defaults to the `accounts` auth provider: multi-user, no external IdP. The
steps below are validated end-to-end:

1. **Deploy from the repo** — New Project → Deploy from GitHub repo → this repo.
   Railway reads `railway.toml` and pulls the image. **Add a Postgres plugin**
   to the project.
2. **Add the `DATABASE_URL` reference on the app service** (required before the
   first successful boot). Adding the Postgres plugin does **not** inject its
   `DATABASE_URL` into the omnigent service. Open the **omnigent** service →
   **Variables**, add a variable named `DATABASE_URL`, and set its value to a
   reference to the Postgres service: `${{Postgres.DATABASE_URL}}`. If your
   database service is named something other than `Postgres`, match that name
   (for example `${{my-db.DATABASE_URL}}`). Until this reference is set, the
   deploy errors with `DATABASE_URL is required` on every boot, so add it, then
   **redeploy**.
3. **Create the first admin.** No credentials are auto-generated. The
   first-boot **Deploy logs** print a "No admin yet" line pointing at your
   `*.up.railway.app` URL (printed once; idempotent — later boots don't
   reprint). Open that URL and use the web Create-admin form to pick your own
   username + password.
4. Log in with the admin you just created, invite teammates from **Members**.

> **`HOST` is handled automatically.** Railway injects `HOST=[::]`, which a
> socket bind can't use and which Railway's IPv4 edge can't reach; the
> entrypoint detects Railway and coerces it to `0.0.0.0`, so no manual `HOST`
> variable is needed. If the generated domain returns "Application failed to
> respond," Railway's port auto-detect picked the wrong port — open
> Settings → Networking and set the domain's target port to the `PORT` Railway
> injected (shown in the boot log as `Uvicorn running on …:<port>`).

> The cookie secret is auto-minted and `OMNIGENT_ACCOUNTS_BASE_URL` is
> auto-detected from `RAILWAY_PUBLIC_DOMAIN`, so those don't need setting. To
> pin a known admin password, set `OMNIGENT_ACCOUNTS_INIT_ADMIN_PASSWORD`
> before first boot.

> **Security note for public deployments:** `POST /auth/setup` is
> unauthenticated while no password-bearing account exists, so an instance
> exposed before you reach the Create-admin form can be claimed by the first
> visitor. Pre-seed `OMNIGENT_ACCOUNTS_INIT_ADMIN_PASSWORD`, or complete setup
> promptly after the deploy goes live.

## Release features

In the Omnigent service's **Variables** tab, set `OMNIGENT_FEATURES` to a
comma-separated enabled set such as `usage_page`. Railway redeploys the service
automatically. Remove the key from the value to roll back, then reload the web
app. See [`designs/FEATURE_FLAGS.md`](../../designs/FEATURE_FLAGS.md) for known
keys.

## Use your own IdP instead (OIDC)

Prefer GitHub / Google / Okta login over built-in accounts? Switch the provider
in the service Variables. OIDC requires HTTPS — Railway provides it
automatically on `*.up.railway.app`. If you set a custom domain, point it at
your project before completing these steps.

### GitHub OAuth (simplest to register)

1. Go to `github.com/settings/developers` → **New OAuth App**.
   - Homepage URL: `https://<project>.up.railway.app`
   - Authorization callback URL: `https://<project>.up.railway.app/auth/callback`
   - Click **Register application**, then **Generate a new client secret**.

2. In your Railway project, open the **omnigent** service → **Variables**
   and add:

   | Variable | Value |
   |---|---|
   | `OMNIGENT_AUTH_PROVIDER` | `oidc` |
   | `OMNIGENT_OIDC_ISSUER` | `https://github.com` |
   | `OMNIGENT_OIDC_CLIENT_ID` | your GitHub OAuth client ID |
   | `OMNIGENT_OIDC_CLIENT_SECRET` | your GitHub OAuth client secret |
   | `OMNIGENT_OIDC_REDIRECT_URI` | `https://<project>.up.railway.app/auth/callback` |
   | `OMNIGENT_OIDC_COOKIE_SECRET` | output of `openssl rand -hex 32` |

3. Railway redeploys automatically. Visit the URL — you'll be redirected to
   GitHub to log in.

### Google Workspace

| Variable | Value |
|---|---|
| `OMNIGENT_AUTH_PROVIDER` | `oidc` |
| `OMNIGENT_OIDC_ISSUER` | `https://accounts.google.com` |
| `OMNIGENT_OIDC_CLIENT_ID` | `…apps.googleusercontent.com` |
| `OMNIGENT_OIDC_CLIENT_SECRET` | your client secret |
| `OMNIGENT_OIDC_REDIRECT_URI` | `https://<project>.up.railway.app/auth/callback` |
| `OMNIGENT_OIDC_COOKIE_SECRET` | output of `openssl rand -hex 32` |
| `OMNIGENT_OIDC_ALLOWED_DOMAINS` | `example.com` (critical — see note below) |

> **Important:** Without `OMNIGENT_OIDC_ALLOWED_DOMAINS`, any Google account
> can log in when the OAuth consent screen is "External." Always restrict to
> your domain.

### Generic OIDC (Okta, Auth0, Keycloak, Entra ID)

Set `OMNIGENT_OIDC_ISSUER` to your IdP's base URL (the one that publishes
`/.well-known/openid-configuration`). The rest of the variables are the same
as above.

## Custom domain

In your Railway project, open **Settings** → **Domains** → **Add domain**.
Point your DNS A/AAAA record at the Railway-assigned address. Railway
provisions a Let's Encrypt cert automatically.

Update `OMNIGENT_OIDC_REDIRECT_URI` to use the custom domain after DNS
propagates.

## Upgrading

Railway redeploys automatically when a new image tag is pushed to GHCR
(if you've configured a webhook) or on demand:

1. In the Railway dashboard, open the **omnigent** service.
2. Click **Deploy** → **Latest** to pull the newest `:latest` image.

## Cost

Railway Hobby plan: ~$5/month base + per-minute CPU/memory usage. A lightly
loaded Omnigent instance (few concurrent users) typically stays under
$10–15/month total including the Postgres plugin.

## Publishing the template

One-time setup done by the repo owner after the repository is public:

1. Go to `railway.com/new/template` and click **Create template**.
2. Point it at `github.com/omnigent-ai/omnigent`.
3. Select the **Postgres** plugin.
4. Pre-fill default env vars with descriptions for the optional OIDC fields.
5. Click **Publish**. Copy the generated deploy URL and update the badge at the
   top of this file and in `deploy/README.md`.

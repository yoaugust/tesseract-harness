// Omnigent <-> Daytona egress relay.
//
// Daytona Tier 1/2 sandboxes can only reach an allowlisted set of public
// domains; *.workers.dev is on that list. This Worker lives there and
// transparently reverse-proxies EVERY request (plain HTTP and WebSocket
// upgrades alike) to the real Omnigent server, so the in-sandbox host's
// dial-back — the host tunnel WS, the runner tunnel WS, and the host's
// plain HTTP calls — all reach the server through the firewall.
//
// SECURITY: this terminates TLS and re-originates, so it can see the
// per-launch host token and tunnel payload. Deploy only a relay you
// control; see README.md (this directory) "Security considerations".

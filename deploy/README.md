# Deploying Omnigent

Omnigent ships several ways to deploy the server, organized by
target platform. Pick the one that matches your environment.

Deploying buys you a stable URL: sessions become reachable from any device,
including your phone (the web UI is built for mobile), and teammates can
join. The server is the coordination point; your code and model keys stay on
the machines that register as hosts (see [Execution model](#execution-model)).

## Deploy in one click

No local tooling needed. Pick a platform, click the button, and your
Omnigent server is live with HTTPS in a few minutes.

| Platform | Button | Docs |
|---|---|---|
| **Render** | [![Deploy to Render](https://render.com/images/deploy-to-render-button.svg)](https://render.com/deploy?repo=https://github.com/omnigent-ai/omnigent) | [`render/README.md`](render/README.md) |
| **Railway** | *(button pending; see below)* | [`railway/README.md`](railway/README.md) |

<!-- TODO(oss-release): publish the Railway template at railway.com/new/template
     once the repo is public, then replace the Railway row above with:
     [![Deploy on Railway](https://railway.com/button.svg)](https://railway.com/deploy/<template-id>)
     Steps: railway.com/new/template → point at public repo → add Postgres plugin
     → publish → copy the deploy URL → update this file and deploy/railway/README.md. -->

Both provision a managed Postgres database automatically and default to the
built-in `accounts` auth provider, so a fresh deploy is multi-user with no
external IdP. First boot auto-creates an admin (password in the service
logs); invite teammates from the web UI. Prefer your own IdP? Switch to OIDC
after deploy by setting the `OMNIGENT_OIDC_*` vars (auth stays enabled; the
issuer is what flips the mode); see the platform README for both
walkthroughs.

**Three more platforms** are supported with a little more setup (not a single
button): **Fly.io** (`fly deploy`, or its web-UI Launch), **Hugging Face
Spaces** (a demo-grade Docker Space), and **Modal** (`modal deploy`, an
always-on web server with a durable artifact Volume). See the menu below.
Fly and HF Spaces can run on the **SQLite lite tier** with no database to
provision (see [Database: Postgres or SQLite](#database-postgres-or-sqlite));
Modal needs a bring-your-own Postgres.

> **On Databricks?** The fully managed
> [Omnigent on Databricks](https://docs.databricks.com/aws/en/omnigent/)
> (Beta) is the recommended path: Databricks operates the server for
> you, wired to workspace identity, Foundation Models, AI Gateway, and
> MLflow Tracing. Enable the **Omnigent** preview in your workspace
> settings. The self-managed Databricks Apps bundle above is for when
> you need control the managed service does not expose yet.

All non-Databricks deploy paths share the same image (`docker/Dockerfile`): a
slim Python container running the FastAPI / WebSocket coordinator, with Postgres
or SQLite as the datastore. The Databricks Apps path uses a separate entrypoint
(`databricks/src/app.py`) that swaps Postgres for Lakebase (managed PostgreSQL)
and the artifact store for UC Volumes.

## Database: Postgres or SQLite

The server supports two database backends, both first-class (same schema, same
migrations; pick per `DATABASE_URL`):

- **Postgres**: the default and the production answer. Required for more than
  one server instance. **Managed and auto-provisioned on deploy** on Render and
  Railway. On platforms without a managed database (HF Spaces, Modal, or Fly
  if you want Postgres over volume-SQLite), bring your own. The quickest is
  **Neon**:
  create one at [pg.new](https://pg.new) and set the connection string as
  `DATABASE_URL`. Any `postgres://` / `postgresql://` URL works (pooled or
  direct); the entrypoint normalizes it to the psycopg3 dialect automatically.
- **SQLite**: a zero-dependency "lite tier" for demos and single-instance
  deploys, with no database to provision. The `.db` file lives on the
  platform's persistent disk/volume (Render disk, Fly volume, Railway volume)
  and survives restarts there; on Hugging Face free Spaces the disk is
  ephemeral, so SQLite data resets on restart, and on Modal the Volume's
  eventual-consistency semantics don't suit a live `.db` file, so skip the
  SQLite tier there. Set
  `DATABASE_URL=sqlite:////data/artifacts/chat.db`. Tradeoff: single instance
  only, no managed backups.

**Who provisions the database.** Render and Railway create the Postgres *as part
of the deploy* (one step; it's owned by your platform account). Platforms
without a managed DB don't: there you either run on SQLite (zero setup,
ephemeral on HF) or bring an owned Postgres like Neon (a one-time signup, then
persistent). A deploy can't auto-provision a *persistent* database for you;
persistence requires an owned account, and that's the one step that can't be
automated away.

**First boot against a remote Postgres is slow.** Migrations run over the
network on the first boot (~1 minute on Neon, vs near-instant for local SQLite);
subsequent boots are fast. Make sure the platform's healthcheck grace tolerates
it: Render and Railway do by default; on Fly, raise `grace_period` if you use a
remote DB.

**Memory floor:** the server's working set is ~512 MB–1 GB. Render Starter
(512 MB), Railway (usage-scaled), and HF Spaces clear it automatically; Fly's
256 MB default does not, so the Fly config pins a 1 GB machine, and the
Modal app pins `memory=1024` for the same reason.

## Serving: put an HTTP/2 proxy in front for many concurrent views

Each open session in the web UI holds a long-lived streaming HTTP
response (`GET /v1/sessions/{id}/stream`, `text/event-stream`) for as
long as the view is on screen. Over **HTTP/1.1 browsers cap concurrent
connections at ~6 per origin**, and every open stream occupies one of
those slots. Open a handful of windows or tabs against the same server
and the pool fills with held-open streams — then every *other* request
the UI makes (sending a message, the session list, `/health`, auth)
queues behind the cap and never fires. The symptom is the whole UI
appearing to freeze across all windows while the server itself is idle;
in DevTools → Network the stuck requests sit in **Stalled/Queued**, not
"waiting for server".

**Fix: serve over HTTP/2.** HTTP/2 multiplexes every stream over one
connection, so the per-origin cap stops mattering. `uvicorn` (the
server's ASGI server) speaks HTTP/1.1 only, so HTTP/2 comes from a
reverse proxy that terminates TLS in front of it — which most real
deploys already have:

- **The bundled Caddy overlay** (`docker/docker-compose.https.yaml`)
  gives you this for free — Caddy negotiates HTTP/2 (and HTTP/3) over
  TLS via ALPN with no extra config. See
  [`docker/README.md`](docker/README.md#multi-user-mode-oidc).
- **The one-click platforms** (Render, Railway, Fly, Cloudflare) and
  managed **Databricks** terminate TLS with HTTP/2 at their edge, so
  they're already covered.

The gap is only when you expose the raw `:8000` HTTP/1.1 port directly
to browsers (e.g. `docker compose up` with no proxy, reached over
plain HTTP). That's fine for a single window; put a proxy in front once
you or your team routinely open several.

## Execution model

Omnigent runs in two pieces that talk to each other over a
WebSocket tunnel:

- **Server**: the FastAPI app you deploy here. Handles HTTP / SSE
  routes, terminal-attach WebSockets, persistence, web UI.
- **Runner (host)**: a Python subprocess that runs on the **user's
  machine** (laptop, dev container, etc.). Dials in to the server
  via `WS /v1/runner/tunnel`, executes the LLM loop + tools locally,
  streams events back.

The deploy options here are all about the server. Runners aren't
deployed; every user launches one on their own machine with
`omnigent run …  --server <url>` or `omnigent claude  --server <url>`.

This separation is why the server image is small (no `tmux`, no
harness SDKs, no LLM API keys in the image) and why no agent code
runs inside it.

## Connect your laptop

Once the server is up, sign in from your machine. The token is reused by
`run`, `attach`, and `host`:

```bash
omnigent login https://your-host
```

`login` detects the server's auth mode automatically. Built-in accounts,
OIDC, header-auth proxies, and Databricks-hosted servers (a Databricks App
or a workspace API path) all work with the same command; for Databricks it
runs `databricks auth login` against the right workspace for you (requires
the `databricks` extra).

Then register the machine as a host, so sessions created in the web UI can
run on it:

```bash
omnigent host https://your-host
```

Or point a one-off run at the server directly:

```bash
omnigent run path/to/agent.yaml --server https://your-host
```

## Run hosts in cloud sandboxes

Don't want a laptop to be the host? Run the host in a cloud sandbox instead.

**From the CLI (Modal, Daytona, Blaxel, Islo, or E2B).** Install the provider extra when needed (`pip install 'omnigent[modal]'`, `'omnigent[daytona]'`, `'omnigent[blaxel]'`, or `'omnigent[e2b]'`; Islo uses the built-in HTTP client). Authenticate with `modal token new`, `DAYTONA_API_KEY`, Blaxel's `BL_WORKSPACE` and `BL_API_KEY`, `ISLO_API_KEY`, or `E2B_API_KEY`. Then run:

```bash
omnigent sandbox create --provider modal     # or --provider daytona / blaxel / islo / e2b
omnigent sandbox connect --provider modal --sandbox-id <id> --server https://your-host
```

> [!NOTE]
> Modal caps sandbox lifetime at 24 hours. Re-run `create` + `connect` to
> roll the host onto a fresh sandbox. Daytona and Islo have no Omnigent-imposed
> lifetime cap; Daytona free-tier orgs restrict egress to an allowlist; see
> [`daytona/README.md`](daytona/README.md) for the relay workaround. E2B
> shares Modal's 24-hour cap **and** boots from a pre-built E2B *template*
> rather than a registry image — build it once first; see
> [`e2b/README.md`](e2b/README.md).

**Server-managed (Modal, Daytona, Blaxel, Islo, E2B, or Gensee).** With
*managed hosts*, creating a session with `"host_type": "managed"` (e.g.
`POST /v1/sessions {"agent_id": ..., "host_type": "managed"}`) makes the
server provision a sandbox, start a host in it, and run the session there.
No laptop, no CLI steps per session; the sandbox is terminated when the
session is deleted. Configuration is a `sandbox:` section in the server
config (`omnigent server -c config.yaml`, or `<data_dir>/config.yaml`):

```yaml
sandbox:
  provider: modal
  server_url: https://your-host        # public URL sandboxes dial back to
  reaper:                              # optional, disabled by default
    enabled: true
    terminate_after_offline_days: 30   # default: 30 days
    sweep_interval_s: 86400            # default: 1 day
```

Modal credentials come from the server's environment (`MODAL_TOKEN_ID` /
`MODAL_TOKEN_SECRET`, or a mounted `~/.modal.toml`), not the config file.
Daytona reads `DAYTONA_API_KEY`. Blaxel reads `BL_WORKSPACE` and `BL_API_KEY`.
Islo reads `ISLO_API_KEY` and optional `ISLO_BASE_URL`. E2B reads `E2B_API_KEY`.
Gensee reads `GENSEE_CONTROLLER_API_TOKEN`; see
[`gensee/README.md`](gensee/README.md) for its managed-only configuration.
All credentials come from the server environment.
Each sandbox authenticates back with a server-minted, per-launch token, so
no user credentials ever enter the sandbox.

The optional reaper runs once for the whole `sandbox:` deployment, including
multi-provider configurations. It queries managed host rows directly and
detaches a sandbox generation only after its host has stayed offline past
`terminate_after_offline_days`. Provider termination failures remain recorded
for a later sweep, while the session history and durable host binding stay
available for a fresh sandbox generation. Both
`terminate_after_offline_days` and `sweep_interval_s` must be positive integers.

**The host image.** Most sandboxes boot from the official prebaked host image (`ghcr.io/omnigent-ai/omnigent-host:latest`, published by CI from the `host` target of [`docker/Dockerfile`](docker/Dockerfile)), so the host starts in seconds instead of installing Omnigent at boot. The image ships the coding-harness CLIs (`claude`, `codex`, `pi`, `kiro-cli`). Blaxel uses `blaxel/omnigent-host:latest`, which combines this host runtime with Blaxel's required `sandbox-api`. E2B uses its provider template. Gensee uses a provider-managed runtime rather than this registry-image setting. To use a custom image with a provider that accepts one, build the same `host` target and point the provider config at it:

```bash
docker build -f docker/Dockerfile --target host \
  -t docker.io/<you>/omnigent-host:latest .
docker push docker.io/<you>/omnigent-host:latest
```

```yaml
sandbox:
  provider: modal
  server_url: https://your-host
  modal:
    image: docker.io/<you>/omnigent-host:latest
```

For private registries, set `OMNIGENT_MODAL_REGISTRY_SECRET` on the server to the name of a Modal secret holding `REGISTRY_USERNAME` and `REGISTRY_PASSWORD`. For CLI-launched sandboxes, `OMNIGENT_MODAL_HOST_IMAGE`, `OMNIGENT_DAYTONA_HOST_IMAGE`, `OMNIGENT_BLAXEL_HOST_IMAGE`, or `OMNIGENT_ISLO_HOST_IMAGE` overrides the image.

**LLM credentials for managed sessions.** A fresh sandbox has no API keys.
Park your provider credentials in a [Modal secret](https://modal.com/secrets)
and list it in the config. Its env vars are injected into every managed
sandbox, and the in-sandbox host forwards the standard harness credential
vars (`ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`, `ANTHROPIC_AUTH_TOKEN`, `ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL`,
`CLAUDE_CODE_OAUTH_TOKEN`, `CODEX_ACCESS_TOKEN`, `OPENAI_API_KEY`,
`OPENAI_BASE_URL`, `GEMINI_API_KEY`, plus their `OMNIGENT_`-prefixed
aliases) to its runners:

```bash
modal secret create omnigent-llm \
  OMNIGENT_ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=sk-ant-… OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-…
```

Prefer `OMNIGENT_ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` for Claude Code API-key auth. Omnigent
resolves it into Claude Code's `apiKeyHelper`, avoiding a raw
`ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` in the Claude CLI process.

```yaml
sandbox:
  provider: modal
  server_url: https://your-host
  modal:
    secrets: [omnigent-llm]
```

For Daytona, Blaxel, and Islo, list server environment variable names under `sandbox.daytona.env`, `sandbox.blaxel.env`, or `sandbox.islo.env`. The launcher copies the current server values into each sandbox:

```yaml
sandbox:
  provider: islo
  server_url: https://your-host
  islo:
    env: [OPENAI_API_KEY, GIT_TOKEN]
```

Using a **Claude subscription** instead of an API key? Run
`claude setup-token` on your own machine and store the resulting long-lived
token as `CLAUDE_CODE_OAUTH_TOKEN` in the secret. A **ChatGPT
Business/Enterprise plan** works the same way via a
[Codex access token](https://developers.openai.com/codex/enterprise/access-tokens)
stored as `CODEX_ACCESS_TOKEN`. For gateway setups or other env vars beyond
the standard set, add `OMNIGENT_RUNNER_ENV_PASSTHROUGH=NAME1,NAME2` to the
secret to name the extra vars the host should forward to runners.

**Private repositories.** Managed sessions can clone a repository as the
session workspace; for private ones, store an HTTPS token as `GIT_TOKEN` in
a Modal secret (GitLab: add `GIT_USERNAME=oauth2`). The host image's git
credential helper picks it up for the clone and for the agent's later
fetch/push.

See the [`modal`](modal/README.md), [`daytona`](daytona/README.md), [`blaxel`](blaxel/README.md), and [`islo`](islo/README.md) guides for provider setup and troubleshooting.

## Auth

Auth is driven by a single switch, `OMNIGENT_AUTH_ENABLED`. The framework
default (a bare local `omnigent server`) leaves it off: single-user
`header` mode, no login. The containerized deploys here (Docker / HF / Render /
Railway / Modal / Fly) set `OMNIGENT_AUTH_ENABLED=1` by default in their
entrypoints,
since a network-exposed instance should be authenticated. With the switch on,
the mode is chosen by your config: supply the `OMNIGENT_OIDC_*` vars and you
get `oidc`, otherwise you get the built-in `accounts` flow.
`OMNIGENT_AUTH_PROVIDER` is an explicit escape hatch that pins the mode and
overrides this auto-selection.

| Mode | When to use | What's needed |
|---|---|---|
| `accounts` (deploy default) | Standalone deploy, no external IdP: built-in username/password with first-user-is-admin bootstrap and UI-based invites. Opt in with `OMNIGENT_AUTH_ENABLED=1` (and no OIDC vars). | Set `OMNIGENT_ACCOUNTS_COOKIE_SECRET` (or let `bootstrap.sh` mint it) and `OMNIGENT_ACCOUNTS_BASE_URL` (public URL). On first boot, set the admin password via the web Create-admin form, the terminal prompt, or `--admin-password` / `OMNIGENT_ACCOUNTS_INIT_ADMIN_PASSWORD`. |
| `oidc` | Standalone deploy with your own IdP: server handles the full login flow | Set `OMNIGENT_AUTH_ENABLED=1` and the `OMNIGENT_OIDC_*` env vars; the presence of `OMNIGENT_OIDC_ISSUER` selects OIDC (or pin `OMNIGENT_AUTH_PROVIDER=oidc`). Requires HTTPS (the session cookie uses the `__Host-` prefix). |
| `header` | Behind an existing SSO proxy (oauth2-proxy, AWS ALB OIDC, Cloudflare Access, Tailscale Funnel, …) that injects an identity header | The default when `OMNIGENT_AUTH_ENABLED` is off; or pin `OMNIGENT_AUTH_PROVIDER=header`. Reads `X-Forwarded-Email` by default; set `OMNIGENT_AUTH_HEADER` for proxies that use another name (e.g. `Cf-Access-Authenticated-User-Email`), and `OMNIGENT_AUTH_HEADER_STRIP_PREFIX=accounts.google.com:` for Google IAP. Proxy MUST strip any inbound copy of the header from clients. Missing headers are always rejected. |

> [!NOTE]
> **Managed sandboxes need `header`/`oidc` or single-user auth.** Each session's
> runner dials back with the *user's* identity, which the built-in `accounts` mode
> (the deploy default above) can't supply over the runner WebSocket — it returns
> `403` even though the host connects. Framework-level; applies to every sandbox
> provider (Modal / Daytona / Islo / Kubernetes / …).

### Single sign-on (OIDC)

The built-in `accounts` flow needs no setup beyond the deploy itself. To let
your team sign in with the accounts they already have (Google, GitHub, Okta,
Microsoft), point the server at your identity provider. In `docker/.env` (or
your platform's env settings):

```dotenv
# Auth is already on (OMNIGENT_AUTH_ENABLED=1) by default in the deploys here.
# Adding an OIDC issuer flips the mode to single sign-on. No extra flag.
OMNIGENT_OIDC_ISSUER=https://accounts.google.com     # or https://github.com / your Okta / Entra URL
OMNIGENT_DOMAIN=agents.yourcompany.com               # your server's domain
OMNIGENT_OIDC_CLIENT_ID=…
OMNIGENT_OIDC_CLIENT_SECRET=…
```

```bash
docker compose up -d        # restart to apply
```

Your team signs in with their existing accounts, and there are no passwords
for you to manage. Nothing else about the app changes.

> [!TIP]
> The only outside step is creating an app with your provider (e.g. Google
> Cloud Console, or GitHub → Settings → Developer settings) to get the client
> ID and secret. Set its **callback URL** to `https://<your-domain>/auth/callback`.

**Decide who's allowed in**, in your server config (`/data/config.yaml`):

```yaml
allowed_domains: [yourcompany.com]    # only your company's emails can sign in
admins: [you@yourcompany.com]         # who can manage members
```

> [!TIP]
> Need to let in one outsider, say a contractor on a personal account? Set
> `OMNIGENT_OIDC_ALLOW_INVITES=1` and send them a one-time invite link,
> instead of opening up the whole allowlist.

**Already have a team on built-in accounts?** One command brings everyone
across when you switch, so they keep their sessions and admin rights:

```bash
omnigent debug migrate-accounts-to-oidc <database-url> --domain yourcompany.com
```

For the provider-specific walkthroughs (GitHub OAuth, Google Workspace,
generic OIDC), see
[`docker/README.md#multi-user-mode-oidc`](docker/README.md#multi-user-mode-oidc).

### Header mode (X-Forwarded-Email)

> [!WARNING]
> Don't deploy a shared server in header-auth mode unless you run a trusted
> reverse proxy.

`header` mode (`OMNIGENT_AUTH_PROVIDER=header`) takes the caller's identity
from a trusted request header — `X-Forwarded-Email` by default. It exists for
deployments that sit behind an SSO proxy (oauth2-proxy, Cloudflare Access, an
ALB/OIDC listener, Databricks Apps) that authenticates the user and injects
that header on every request.

Proxies that authenticate with a different header name set
`OMNIGENT_AUTH_HEADER` to that name instead of standing up an extra hop to
rename it. For example, behind **Cloudflare Access** (which provides the
authenticated email in `Cf-Access-Authenticated-User-Email`):

```dotenv
OMNIGENT_AUTH_PROVIDER=header
OMNIGENT_AUTH_HEADER=Cf-Access-Authenticated-User-Email
```

Some proxies namespace the identity they inject. **Google IAP** forwards the
email in `X-Goog-Authenticated-User-Email` prefixed with `accounts.google.com:`
(e.g. `accounts.google.com:user@example.com`). Set
`OMNIGENT_AUTH_HEADER_STRIP_PREFIX` to drop that prefix and recover the bare
email:

```dotenv
OMNIGENT_AUTH_PROVIDER=header
OMNIGENT_AUTH_HEADER=X-Goog-Authenticated-User-Email
OMNIGENT_AUTH_HEADER_STRIP_PREFIX=accounts.google.com:
```

In header mode **the server trusts whatever that header says**. If no proxy
sets it, requests are rejected (`401`) rather than silently sharing one
identity. But a *misconfigured* proxy is still dangerous: if the proxy
doesn't **strip** any client-supplied copy of the identity header before
forwarding, anyone can impersonate anyone by sending the header themselves.
Getting this wrong exposes every user's sessions, conversation history, tool
output, and files to every other caller.

**For almost everyone, use built-in `accounts` (the default in these
deploys) or `oidc`**; both authenticate users at the server with no proxy to
get right. Only choose `header` when you already operate a proxy you trust
to set and sanitize the identity header, and read
[`docker/README.md#header-proxy-mode-for-deploys-behind-an-existing-sso-proxy`](docker/README.md#header-proxy-mode-for-deploys-behind-an-existing-sso-proxy)
first.

## Branding (white-labeling)

Customize the app name, landing heading, and logos with a `branding:` block in
the server config (`omnigent server -c config.yaml`, or `<data_dir>/config.yaml`
— `/data/config.yaml` in the Docker stack). Takes effect on the next server
start.

```yaml
branding:
  app_name: "Acme Agent"        # tab title, sidebar wordmark, login screen
  heading: "How can I help?"     # landing hero; "" hides it, omit to keep the default
  logo:                          # a bare string sets `main`; or per-variant:
    main: logo.png               # branding-assets/logo.png
    loading: loading.webp        # working indicator (falls back to main)
    favicon: favicon.png         # browser-tab icon
  powered_by: true               # "Powered by Omnigent" credit; false to hide
```

Logo files must live under a dedicated `branding-assets/` directory beside the
config file (for example, `/data/branding-assets/logo.png`). PNG, JPEG, GIF,
WebP, and ICO files up to 5 MiB are accepted only after full decoder validation.
ICO files must contain only PNG-backed entries; every directory entry is bounded
and decoded independently, while DIB/BMP-backed entries are rejected. Malformed,
truncated, oversized, overlapping, trailing-payload, SVG, symlinked, escaped, and
non-image files are ignored. Images are also bounded to 4096 pixels per side,
128 frames, 16 megapixels per frame, and 64 megapixels across all decoded frames.
The values are served over the unauthenticated `GET /v1/info` and
`GET /v1/branding/logo/<variant>` endpoints so the login screen is branded before
sign-in. Any unset field keeps its built-in default, so a partial block is fine.

The small "Powered by Omnigent" credit under the landing composer appears only
once you set custom branding; `powered_by: false` hides it even then. It always
shows the Omnigent mascot, never your logo.

## Adding a new deploy target

Drop a new subdirectory under `deploy/<target>/` with a `README.md`
and `SKILL.md`. If the new target uses the existing Docker image,
your work is mostly platform-specific glue (a `fly.toml`, a Cloud
Run service.yaml, a Helm chart, an HF Spaces config) plus a README
that explains how to point that platform at `docker/Dockerfile`.

Update this top-level README with a row in the table above.

# Omnigent on microsandbox

[microsandbox](https://github.com/superradcompany/microsandbox) is an embedded microVM runtime that boots standard OCI images directly as hardware-isolated VMs (libkrun).
Each Omnigent host runs inside its own VM with its own kernel - no shared host kernel, unlike Docker/Podman containers - and boots in well under a second once the image is cached.

The microsandbox provider is fully local and self-hosted: the SDK embeds the runtime in the Omnigent server (or CLI) process.
**No daemon, no server component, no cloud account, no API key.**
Sandbox state lives under `~/.microsandbox` on the machine running Omnigent.

Both integration surfaces are supported:

- **Server-managed** - the server provisions a VM automatically when a session is created with `"host_type": "managed"`, starts `omnigent host` inside it, and removes it when the session is deleted.
- **CLI bootstrap** - `omnigent sandbox create --provider microsandbox` builds your local wheels, boots a VM, overlays the wheels, and attaches, including the in-sandbox App OAuth flow (microsandbox is the first OSS provider with a working local port-forward).

Idle VMs drain themselves (default: after 24h), keeping their writable layer, and are resumed in place on the next use - a drained host restarts in about 100ms.

## Prerequisites

```bash
pip install 'omnigent[microsandbox]'   # installs the microsandbox SDK extra (runtime bundled)
```

Hardware virtualization on the machine running the Omnigent server (or CLI):

- **macOS:** Apple Silicon (Intel Macs are not supported).
- **Linux:** KVM enabled and accessible - `/dev/kvm` must exist and the user must be in the `kvm` group (glibc distros only).

No other install is needed - the Python wheel bundles the runtime and libkrunfw.
The optional `msb` CLI (`brew install superradcompany/tap/microsandbox`) is handy for debugging (`msb doctor`, `msb ls`, `msb logs <name>`).

> **Beta software:** microsandbox is explicitly beta with a breaking-change warning, which is why the extra pins `>=0.6.9,<0.7`.
> Do not bump the minor without re-running the smoke test below.

## Server configuration

Add a `sandbox:` block to your server config (`omnigent server -c ...` / `OMNIGENT_CONFIG` / `<data_dir>/config.yaml`):

```yaml
sandbox:
  provider: microsandbox
  server_url: http://host.microsandbox.internal:8799   # see below
```

`provider` + `server_url` is a complete config: the image defaults to the official prebaked host image and VMs run locally.

**`server_url` for a local server:** the in-VM host dials back to the server, and `localhost` inside the VM is the VM itself.
When the Omnigent server runs on the same machine as the VMs (the usual local setup), point `server_url` at `host.microsandbox.internal` (the guest's stable name for its host machine) with the server's port.
A genuinely public `https://...` URL works as-is.

All knobs:

```yaml
sandbox:
  provider: microsandbox
  server_url: http://host.microsandbox.internal:8799
  microsandbox:
    image: ghcr.io/acme/omnigent-host:latest  # optional; default: official image
    env: [OPENAI_API_KEY, GIT_TOKEN]          # optional; SERVER env var NAMES
    cpus: 2                                   # optional; default 2
    memory_mib: 4096                          # optional; default 4096
    idle_timeout_s: 86400                     # optional; default 24h, 0 disables draining
    network: host                             # optional; host (default) | public-only | all
    host_ports: [8317]                        # optional; extra guest-to-host TCP ports
```

### Network modes

| Mode | Guest can reach |
|------|-----------------|
| `host` (default) | Public internet plus selected ports on the host machine (`host.microsandbox.internal`), while loopback, private LANs, and cloud metadata stay blocked. |
| `public-only` | Public internet only, for public `server_url` values that do not need local dial-back. CLI App OAuth port-forwarding still works. |
| `all` | Everything, including private LANs. |

Under `host` mode, VMs run untrusted agent code on the same machine as the server, so guest-to-host access is always scoped to a TCP port allowlist.
Managed VMs allow the `server_url` port when it uses `host.microsandbox.internal`, plus any explicit `host_ports` entries.
List the ports of host-local services agents legitimately need - e.g. `host_ports: [8317]` for a local LLM gateway the sandbox env points at via `http://host.microsandbox.internal:8317`.
Everything else on the host stays unreachable.
CLI-bootstrap VMs allow only the local `--server` port; public server URLs add no host rule.

### Environment variables

| Variable | Purpose |
|----------|---------|
| `OMNIGENT_MICROSANDBOX_HOST_IMAGE` | Override the host image (alternative to `sandbox.microsandbox.image`). |
| `OMNIGENT_MICROSANDBOX_SANDBOX_ENV` | Comma-separated SERVER env var names to inject into VMs (alternative to `sandbox.microsandbox.env`). |

The `env` names resolve to their values from the **server's own environment** at provision time - typically the harness LLM credentials (`ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`, `OPENAI_API_KEY`, gateway base URLs) and `GIT_TOKEN` the in-VM host forwards to runners.
Names only, so secret values never live in the config file.

## CLI bootstrap

```bash
omnigent sandbox create --provider microsandbox --server https://omnigent.example.com
```

Builds the local wheels, provisions a VM from the host image, overlays the wheels, runs the in-sandbox App OAuth flow when the server needs it, and holds the host open in the foreground.
The OAuth callback binds on the local host and bridges into the guest over the SDK exec channel, so it works under every network mode and needs `python3` in the image (the official host image has it).

## How it works

1. The server provisions a detached VM from the prebaked host image (`Sandbox.create(image=..., detached=True)`), named `<label>-<random>` so repeated creates never collide.
   Detached VMs survive server restarts; any process reconnects by name.
2. The network policy allows public egress plus guest-to-host traffic (the `host` mode above), so the in-VM host can reach `server_url` even when the server is on the same machine.
3. The server runs `omnigent host` inside the VM with a one-time launch token in its environment; the host dials back over a WebSocket tunnel and registers.
   From there the session rides the same host/runner machinery every Omnigent host uses - the agent's runner, tools, and shell all execute inside the VM.
4. After `idle_timeout_s` of inactivity the VM drains: compute and memory are released, the writable layer (workspace, installed tools) is kept.
   The server's wake path resumes it in place (`can_resume`); resume takes about 100ms.
5. On VM death (a crash, or you `msb rm` it), the durable host identity survives and the next message relaunches a fresh VM generation.

Inspect VMs with `msb ls` / `msb logs <name>`; the in-VM host logs to `/tmp/omnigent-host.log`.

## Smoke test

`tests/e2e/integrations/deploy/microsandbox/microsandbox_smoke_test.py` drives the real launcher end to end (provision, exec, file shipping, streaming, port-forward relay, stop/resume, terminate) against a small stock image:

```bash
python tests/e2e/integrations/deploy/microsandbox/microsandbox_smoke_test.py
```

Pass `--image ghcr.io/omnigent-ai/omnigent-host:latest` to smoke the real host image (first pull takes a few minutes).

## Limitations

- **Same-machine only.**
  VMs run where the Omnigent server (or CLI) runs; there is no remote pool mode (unlike boxlite's `cloud:`).
- **Platform floor.** Apple Silicon macOS or KVM glibc Linux; no Intel Macs, no musl/Alpine hosts, Windows support in microsandbox is preview and untested here.
- **`/tmp` is tmpfs.**
  Guest `/tmp` does not survive a drain/resume cycle; the writable layer (everything else, including `$HOME`) does.
- **A server killed mid-provision can orphan a VM.**
  Provisioning runs on a worker thread; if the server process dies at exactly the wrong moment, the created VM is never recorded.
  The idle-drain timeout parks such a VM automatically; `msb ls` / `msb rm` cleans it up.
- **Beta runtime.** See the pin note under Prerequisites.

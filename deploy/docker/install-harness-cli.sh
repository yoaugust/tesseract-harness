#!/usr/bin/env bash
# install-harness-cli.sh — install optional harness CLIs into an Omnigent host
# image, selected by harness NAME.
#
# The host image's default CLI set (claude / codex / pi via npm, plus pinned
# kiro-cli and agy) has no shared inclusion policy for additions yet, so this
# script is the opt-in extension point: a downstream deployment names the extra
# harnesses it wants baked in — via the EXTRA_HARNESS_CLIS build-arg — instead
# of forking the Dockerfile:
#
#   docker build -t omnigent-host:latest --target host \
#                -f deploy/docker/Dockerfile \
#                --build-arg EXTRA_HARNESS_CLIS="goose jcode opencode" .
#
# Each entry is NAME[@VERSION]; VERSION pins the CLI the way the harness's own
# installer expects (an npm dist-tag/semver, GOOSE_VERSION, JCODE_VERSION, ...).
# An entry of the form npm:<pkg-spec> installs an
# arbitrary npm package directly — the escape hatch for a CLI this script has
# no row for yet (npm: entries skip the post-install binary smoke check, since
# the binary name isn't known here).
#
# Why names instead of raw npm specs: the row knows HOW the harness ships.
# Several harness CLIs are not npm packages at all (goose and jcode ship
# single-binary vendor installers), and for the npm ones the row carries the
# right package and default pin (e.g. opencode → opencode-ai@~1.18.0, mirroring
# omnigent/onboarding/harness_install.py — keep the two in sync). An unknown
# name fails the build loudly instead of npm-installing an unrelated package
# that happens to share the name.
#
# Binaries land on a system PATH dir (/usr/local/bin) that every sandbox user
# shares, and each row is smoke-checked twice: once under a fresh HOME (a CLI
# that only works from the build user's home — e.g. state the installer left
# under /root — fails here), then re-run as the non-root `sandbox` user the
# OpenShell provider runs agents as (a binary reachable only through the build
# user's home would pass the fresh-HOME check yet break the first
# managed-sandbox session; images without a `sandbox` user, like UBI, skip it).
#
# Supported rows — the CLI-gated harnesses NOT in the default image set (the
# canonical list is _HARNESS_INSTALL in omnigent/onboarding/harness_install.py):
#   opencode  → npm opencode-ai (default pin ~1.18.0, as harness_install.py)
#   qwen      → npm @qwen-code/qwen-code
#   goose     → vendor installer (aaif-goose/goose download_cli.sh), default
#               pin 1.38.0 (mirroring _GOOSE_MIN_VERSION)
#   jcode     → vendor installer (1jehuang/jcode install.sh) — jcode is a
#               builtin harness (omnigent/acp_cli_harnesses.py); a managed
#               deployment still needs the binary on the host's PATH, since
#               the sandbox cannot run the installer at session start
#   cursor    → vendor installer (cursor.com/install) — always fetches the
#               latest agent build, so VERSION pins are rejected
#   kimi      → vendor installer (code.kimi.com/kimi-code/install.sh)
#   agy       → pinned per-arch GitHub release asset + sha256 (AGY_VERSION +
#               the two AGY_SHA256_* values) — the same control as the default
#               image, exposed as a row because UBI does not bake agy by default
#
# hermes is deliberately NOT a row: it requires Node >= 26 at runtime (its
# installer self-installs a managed Node into the installing user's
# HERMES_HOME) while the host images ship Node 22 — it needs the image's
# Node baseline raised first, not just a baked binary.
#
# Supply-chain note: only agy here (and kiro-cli baked in the Dockerfile) is
# pinned to an immutable asset + sha256. The vendor-installer rows (goose,
# jcode, cursor, kimi) run the harness's own curl-piped install script off
# mutable refs and are checked only with `--version`; cursor cannot be
# pinned at all.
# Off-by-default bounds this, but a deployment needing kiro-cli-grade integrity
# should pin + verify in its own image rather than rely on a name here.
#
# Default-set CLIs are deliberately not rows: claude/codex/pi install unpinned
# from npm in the Dockerfiles (override via the npm: escape hatch, e.g.
# npm:@openai/codex@0.147.0), and kiro-cli is version-pinned there via the
# KIRO_CLI_VERSION build ARG. agy IS a row (see install_agy) because UBI does
# not install it by default.
#
# Also runnable by hand on any Linux host with bash, curl, and npm (for the
# npm rows) — e.g. to test a row before rebuilding an image:
#   bash deploy/docker/install-harness-cli.sh goose jcode@0.75.5

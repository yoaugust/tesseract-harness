## Contributor PR security gate

CI for untrusted PRs is held behind a deterministic security scan so that
untrusted code is not checked out, built, or run on our runners — and the
Actions cache is not touched — until the diff has been vetted. It is split into
two pieces so the scan work happens only **once per PR**:

- **`.github/workflows/security-scan.yml`** — runs the deterministic scan once
  on `pull_request` and produces the `Security Scan` check.
- **`.github/workflows/security-gate.yml`** — a reusable poller run as the first
  job (`gate`) of every CI workflow (`ci`, `lint`, `e2e`, `e2e-ui`, web
  tests); the real jobs declare `needs: gate`. It does not re-scan — for an
  untrusted PR it waits for the `Security Scan` check and mirrors its result
  (failure → the dependent CI jobs are skipped); trusted authors and non-PR
  events proceed immediately.

By trust tier (GitHub `author_association`):

- **Trusted** (`OWNER` / `MEMBER` / `COLLABORATOR`) and all non-PR events
  (push, schedule, dispatch): the gate passes through instantly, no scan.
- **Returning contributor** (`CONTRIBUTOR`): the gate runs the scan; a clean
  result lets CI proceed automatically, a finding blocks all CI.
- **First-time contributor**: GitHub's native *“require approval to run fork
  pull request workflows”* repo setting already holds every workflow until a
  maintainer clicks **Approve and run**; after approval the gate's scan still
  applies.

The scan inspects the PR diff for committed secrets, secret-exfiltration shapes
(a secret-named credential source plus a network sink in one file, an
`os.environ` dump, a decode-then-exec, or a reverse shell), changes to
privileged repo config (CI workflows, `.github/MAINTAINER`, `CODEOWNERS`,
`.github/scripts`), CI-workflow misuse (`pull_request_target` + PR-head
checkout, unpinned actions), and known code-execution / obfuscation patterns
(semgrep, local ruleset). It only *statically* analyses the diff and runs with
**no secrets** on fork PRs,
and the scanner itself always runs from `main`, so a PR cannot weaken its own
scan.

This is **not** a merge-required check: it gates CI, not the merge button
directly. When enforcing, merge stays blocked transitively (the skipped
pytest/e2e checks are required) and `Maintainer Approval` remains the ultimate
gate.

It is **blocking**: a finding fails the `Security Scan` check, the pollers mirror
that failure, and the dependent CI jobs are skipped. Detectors run fail-fast, so
a clean PR must pass every one.

### Maintainer override

A maintainer can waive the scan on a specific PR with the **`skip-security-scan`**
label (same convention as `skip-e2e-ui-test`). The waiver is only honored when it
is *maintainer-effective*: the label is present **and** the PR author is a
maintainer, or a maintainer's latest decisive review is `APPROVED`. The label
alone does nothing — applying labels needs triage access, and the extra
maintainer check is defence in depth — so a fork contributor cannot self-waive.
The label and review state are read from the API, and the decision runs from
`should-scan.sh` on `main`, so a PR cannot edit the waiver logic.

To use it: a maintainer reviews/approves the PR and applies `skip-security-scan`;
the `Security Scan` check re-runs and passes, then the blocked CI workflows are
re-run (or the contributor pushes) so their gate jobs see the now-green scan.
The waiver stays effective across pushes while the maintainer approval stands —
remove the label (or dismiss the approval) to re-enable scanning.

# Publishing the Omnigent VS Code extension

This directory holds the Omnigent VS Code extension. It is published
under the shared **`databricks`** VS Code Marketplace publisher (and the
`databricks` Open VSX namespace), which means releases flow through the
Databricks security-hardened release path — direct publishing from this repo is
blocked by policy.

The work splits into two halves:

- **This repo** builds a SHA256-verified `.vsix` and attaches it to a GitHub
release. No marketplace tokens live here.
- **A Databricks-internal secure-release repo** downloads that `.vsix`, verifies
the checksum, scans it, and publishes to the VS Code Marketplace and Open VSX.
It holds the tokens and the approval gate.

Two existing workflows in the secure repo are the reference: the Databricks VS
Code extension publish flow (the one to adapt) and omnigent's PyPI release
(which already checks out `omnigent-ai/omnigent` cross-org). Maintainers: the
repo name and workflow paths are in the maintainer release runbook.

## Steps to release

No tags are pushed by hand — the version flows from a reviewed PR into the
`.vsix` and the release tag, so they can't diverge. The `.vsix` is built from a
**frozen `release/vscode-v<version>` branch**, not `main`, so commits that land
on `main` mid-release can't leak into the artifact. Both dispatch workflows
default to `dry_run: true`; flip it to `false` to actually push the branch /
create the release.

1. **Cut the release branch.** Run the **VS Code Extension Release PR** workflow
   (`vscode-release-pr.yml`) with the target version (e.g. `0.2.0`) and
   `dry_run: false`. It cuts the `release/vscode-v0.2.0` branch, bumps
   `editors/vscode/package.json`, drafts a `CHANGELOG.md` section, and opens a
   `Release (vscode): v0.2.0` PR. (A `dry_run: true` pass just shows the diff in
   the run summary without pushing.) Review the PR — but **don't merge yet**.
2. **Build the draft release.** Run the **VS Code Extension Release** workflow
   (`vscode-extension-release.yml`) with the **same version** and
   `dry_run: false`. It checks out the `release/vscode-v0.2.0` branch (not
   `main`), verifies the branch's `package.json` matches, builds the `.vsix` +
   `.sha256`, and creates a **draft** `vscode-v<version>` release (a dedicated
   tag namespace kept separate from the Python release tags `v[0-9]*`). A
   `dry_run: true` pass builds and checksums without creating the release.
3. **Publish the draft.** The workflow leaves the release as a draft: it is not
   public and the `vscode-v<version>` git tag is not created until you publish.
   On GitHub, open the repo's **Releases** page, find the draft, confirm the
   attached `.vsix` + `.sha256` and the notes look right, then click **Publish
   release**. Publishing creates the tag on the frozen branch commit and makes
   the release downloadable by the secure-repo workflow.
4. **Merge the release PR into `main`** (now that the tag is cut) so the version
   bump and CHANGELOG land on `main`.
5. **Smoke-test the `.vsix` locally.** Download the `.vsix` from the published
   release and install it into a clean VS Code, then confirm the extension
   activates and opens a local server:

   ```bash
   gh release download vscode-v<version> --repo omnigent-ai/omnigent --pattern '*.vsix'
   code --install-extension omnigent-vscode-<version>.vsix
   ```

   Reload VS Code, start a local server (`omnigent server`), and run the
   **Omnigent: Open** command — confirm it opens an editor pane showing the
   running server's UI (not a blank pane or an error). This catches packaging
   problems (missing files, a broken bundle) before anything reaches the
   marketplaces.
6. **Publish to the marketplaces.** Dispatch `omnigent-vscode.yml` in the
   secure-release repo (once it exists), pointing at the `vscode-v<version>`
   tag; run with `dry-run: true` first, then publish for real.

The one-time setup that makes this possible is tracked below.

Steps 1–4 are complete in this repo. Steps 5–7 need the DECO grant and the
secure-repo reference workflow.

## Notes for the secure-repo workflow

- `databricks-vscode.yml` downloads the `.vsix` from the release with
`gh release download -R databricks/databricks-vscode`. The omnigent variant
must point `-R` at `omnigent-ai/omnigent` and relax the filename check (it
hard-codes `databricks-*-${VERSION}.vsix`; ours is `omnigent-vscode-*.vsix`).
- We author `omnigent-vscode.yml` ourselves — it's our own pipeline, not a fork
of `databricks-vscode.yml`, so we just write it to expect our `vscode-v*`
tags. `databricks-vscode.yml` is only a structural template; its
`Validate tag format` step hard-codes `^release-v([0-9]+\.[0-9]+\.[0-9]+)$`,
which is *their* convention — when copying that step, change the regex to
match `vscode-v*`. The only thing that must agree is our two ends
(`vscode-extension-release.yml` and `omnigent-vscode.yml`), and we control
both.
- Cross-org fetch from the public `omnigent-ai/omnigent` repo is already an
accepted pattern — `omnigent.yml` checks out `omnigent-ai/omnigent` for the
PyPI release. So reading a public omnigent release from the hardened runner is
not a new blocker.
- Marketplace publish reads **dedicated `OMNI_VSCE_TOKEN` / `OMNI_OVSX_PAT`
secrets**, separate from databricks-vscode's `VSCE_TOKEN` / `OVSX_PAT`. Same
`databricks` publisher, but distinct tokens so the two teams' release schedules
and the mandatory revoke-after-release step never conflict. (Note: a GitHub
`environment:` alone would NOT isolate repo-level secrets — the distinct secret
names are what isolate the tokens. The jobs also bind an
`omnigent-vscode-marketplace` environment for an independent reviewer gate.)
DECO must add these secrets (step 5) before the first publish.

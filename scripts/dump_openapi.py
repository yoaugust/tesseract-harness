"""Generate and post-process the omnigent OpenAPI 3.2 document.

The omnigent server runs on FastAPI 0.135.x, which emits OpenAPI
3.1. OpenAPI 3.2 (released September 2025) introduced first-class
support for sequential media types — specifically, the
``itemSchema`` keyword for describing each item in a streaming
response on a ``text/event-stream`` content entry. We need 3.2's
``itemSchema`` so the SSE routes describe their per-event shape
correctly to consuming SDK / docs tooling.

This script:

1. Imports :func:`omnigent.server.app.create_app` and instantiates
   it against in-memory store stubs (no DB needed).
2. Calls ``app.openapi()`` to get the FastAPI-generated 3.1 dict.
3. Bumps the top-level ``openapi`` field to ``"3.2.0"``.
4. Materializes the :data:`ServerStreamEvent` discriminated union as
   a top-level entry under ``components.schemas`` so SSE responses
   can ``$ref`` it.
5. Rewrites the ``text/event-stream`` content entries on the SSE
   routes to use the OAS 3.2 ``itemSchema`` keyword in place of
   FastAPI's 3.1 ``schema`` keyword.
6. Stamps numeric ``format`` (``int64`` / ``double``) onto formatless
   component schemas so typed-language generators pick the same
   width as the Python producer.
7. Writes the result to ``openapi.json`` at the repo root.

Run with no arguments to (re)generate the file. Pass ``--check``
in CI to verify the on-disk file is up to date — non-zero exit
means a developer changed the spec without regenerating.

Usage::

    python scripts/dump_openapi.py             # write openapi.json
    python scripts/dump_openapi.py --check     # exit 1 if drifted

# description, no ``info.description``, and only bare snake_case tags.
# We inject that connective tissue here so the published reference
# (rendered by Scalar on the omnigent website) is usable for building
# an integration. Keeping it in this script — rather than scattering it
# across the route decorators — confines presentation concerns to the
# spec-generation layer, and the drift test
# (``tests/server/test_openapi_drift.py``) guards the result.

# Self-hosted base URL. ``omnigent server`` binds 127.0.0.1:6767 by
# default (see ``_DEFAULT_LOCAL_PORT`` in
# ``omnigent/host/local_server.py``).

_INFO_DESCRIPTION: str = """\
Omnigent is an open-source meta-harness for building and running AI \
agents. This is the REST API exposed by the Omnigent server: use it to \
create and drive **sessions**, manage **agents**, **hosts**, and \
**runners**, attach **contextual policies**, post **comments**, and work \
with session **resources** — files, terminals, and sandboxed \
environments.

## Base URL

Omnigent is self-hosted. The server binds `http://127.0.0.1:6767` by \
default (`omnigent server`); point the base URL at your own deployment.

## Authentication

There is no API-key or bearer-token scheme. Identity is supplied by the \
deployment's configured auth provider (`OMNIGENT_AUTH_PROVIDER`):

- **Trusted proxy header** (default) — an upstream proxy injects an \
identity header (`X-Forwarded-Email`, configurable). Single-user local \
runtimes fall back to a reserved `local` user.
- **Session cookie** — a signed session cookie minted after an \
interactive OIDC or accounts login. It is named `ap_session` over HTTP \
(the advertised local default) and `__Host-ap_session` under HTTPS, where \
the `__Host-` prefix guards against subdomain cookie-tossing.

Auth is configured server-side; clients send the cookie or proxy header \
according to your deployment.

## Streaming

`GET /v1/sessions/{session_id}/stream` streams Server-Sent Events \
(`text/event-stream`). Each event conforms to the `ServerStreamEvent` \
schema documented below.
"""

# Auth representations. Omnigent has no bearer/API-key scheme — identity
# arrives via a trusted-proxy header or a signed session cookie,
# selected by ``OMNIGENT_AUTH_PROVIDER``. We model both as OpenAPI
# ``apiKey`` schemes so SDK generators and the reference can surface
# them. We deliberately do NOT assert a top-level ``security``
# requirement: the active scheme is deployment-specific, and public
# endpoints (``/health``, ``/api/version``) require none — the prose in
# :data:`_INFO_DESCRIPTION` carries the human-facing explanation.

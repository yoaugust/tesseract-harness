"""Normalize package indexes in ``uv.lock`` to public PyPI.

Local ``uv`` runs resolve against whatever index is configured on the
developer's machine (e.g. the Databricks PyPI proxy via ``UV_INDEX_URL``
or ``~/.config/uv``), and ``uv`` rewrites every
``source = { registry = "<url>" }`` entry in ``uv.lock`` to that index.
For this OSS repo the committed lockfile must always point at public
PyPI (``https://pypi.org/simple``) so the lock is reproducible for
contributors who don't have the proxy — CI already pins
``UV_INDEX_URL: https://pypi.org/simple`` for the same reason.

This is a pre-commit *fixer*: it rewrites the lockfile in place and
exits non-zero when it changed anything, so the commit aborts and the
developer re-stages the normalized lockfile (mirroring
``end-of-file-fixer`` and friends). Only ``registry`` sources are
touched; ``git`` / ``path`` / ``editable`` sources are left alone.

Pass ``--check`` to validate without writing: it exits non-zero (and
names the offending URLs) when a file is *not* already canonical, but
leaves it untouched. CI runs this mode against the committed lockfile
*before* any ``uv`` command — a plain ``uv run pre-commit`` can't catch a
committed proxy URL, because ``uv`` re-syncs the working tree to CI's
own index (``pypi.org``) first and masks it.

Usage::

    python scripts/normalize_uv_lock_registry.py uv.lock           # fix
    python scripts/normalize_uv_lock_registry.py --check uv.lock   # verify

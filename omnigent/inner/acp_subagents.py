"""Normalized sub-agent lifecycle for ACP agents.

The Agent Client Protocol has not standardized sub-agents. An RFD proposes a
``tool_call`` with ``kind: "subagent"`` plus a ``childSessionId`` and a distinct
child ``sessionId``, but no shipping agent emits that yet, so an agent that
spawns sub-agents reports them in its own dialect.

This module owns only the **generic** half: a small normalized lifecycle
(:class:`SubAgentStart` / :class:`SubAgentEnd`, plus :class:`SubAgentActivity`
for a tool call the sub-agent ran) and the :class:`AcpSubAgentSource` protocol
that maps one dialect onto it. It reads no vendor field and names no vendor;
:class:`~omnigent.inner.acp_executor.AcpExecutor` runs whatever sources its
:class:`~omnigent.inner.acp_extension.AcpExtension` supplies and emits the
matching :class:`~omnigent.inner.executor.SubAgentStarted` /
:class:`~omnigent.inner.executor.SubAgentCompleted` /
:class:`~omnigent.inner.executor.SubAgentToolCall`, which the runner turns into
an Omnigent child session and its transcript so the web "Subagents" panel lists
one row per child with the work it did.

A vendor's dialect lives with that vendor — see
:class:`omnigent.inner.devin.subagents.DevinSubAgentSource` for the worked
example — so supporting another agent means adding one source in that agent's
own package, with nothing here or downstream to change. When ACP standardizes
the convention, a single source keyed on the standard fields covers every
compliant agent at once, and can ship here rather than per-vendor.

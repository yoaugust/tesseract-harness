"""Parent-side L7 egress proxy controller.

Encapsulates the asyncio thread / MITM proxy / Unix socket /
random relay port / optional Proxy-Authorization token setup that
sits BEHIND every sandbox spec carrying ``egress_rules``.

Two callers:

1. :class:`omnigent.inner.os_env._HelperProcessClient` — sandboxed
   helper subprocess that handles ``sys_os_*`` tool calls. Uses the
   controller with ``require_auth=True`` because the helper has an
   inherited config FD it can use to receive the token out of band
   and inject it into ``HTTP_PROXY`` in-process after exec (so the
   token never lands in ``ps -E`` snapshots).

2. :class:`omnigent.inner.terminal.TerminalInstance` — interactive
   sandboxed shell run under tmux. Uses the controller with
   ``require_auth=False`` because the launcher script in tmux has
   no out-of-band channel for the token (tmux closes inherited FDs
   before exec), and embedding the token in the ``HTTP_PROXY`` env
   would leak it via ``ps -E`` on every shell child anyway. The
   relay's other defenses (random ephemeral port, bind-fails-loud,
   per-terminal scratch tmpdir for the socket, default-deny on
   private destinations) still hold.

The controller does NOT own the scratch tmpdir — callers create
and pass one in (``tmpdir``) so they can manage its lifecycle
together with their other sandbox state. The controller writes
the CA bundle into the tmpdir and creates the Unix socket inside
it, so the tmpdir must outlive :meth:`EgressProxyController.stop`.

"""TCP-to-Unix-socket relay for egress proxy hard enforcement.

Runs inside the network namespace on loopback. Programs connect to
``127.0.0.1:{relay_port}`` (set via ``HTTP_PROXY`` / ``HTTPS_PROXY``),
and this relay bridges each connection to the parent process's egress
proxy via a bind-mounted Unix socket.

The relay is started as a background daemon thread during sandbox
activation (:meth:`activate`) so that it's available before the
helper's RPC loop begins accepting commands.

Security:

- **Fail-loud bind**: If ``asyncio.start_server`` fails (e.g. port
  already bound by another process), :func:`start_relay` raises
  :class:`OSError`. Older versions silently logged and continued,
  letting the helper's HTTP traffic flow to whatever was already
  on the port — a same-user-process MITM risk on macOS where
  there's no network namespace isolation.
- **Random port**: The parent picks an ephemeral port via
  :func:`socket.bind('127.0.0.1', 0)` per helper rather than the
  legacy hardcoded ``18080``, so port-squat attacks must race
  every helper start instead of pre-binding a well-known port.

Historical note: a prior revision enforced a
``Proxy-Authorization: Basic <base64(omnigent:token)>`` header on
every inbound connection, with the token shared between parent and
helper via :class:`omnigent.inner.sandbox.SandboxPolicy.
egress_auth_token`. That mechanism was removed because the token
was carried on the helper's ``Popen`` argv (visible via
``/proc/<pid>/cmdline`` and ``ps`` to any same-UID process), making
it the WEAKEST secret in the system — strictly weaker than the
random-ephemeral-port + fail-loud-bind guarantees the relay still
provides. The auth path also added per-connection latency for no
net protection gain. See ``omnigent/inner/os_env.py:
_start_egress_proxy_locked`` for the matching parent-side change.

    """Start the TCP-to-Unix relay as a background daemon thread.

    The relay listens on ``127.0.0.1:{relay_port}`` and forwards
    each accepted connection to the Unix socket at *unix_socket_path*.
    The thread is daemonic and exits when the process terminates.

    Security: the bind happens synchronously here (not in the
    background thread) so a failed bind raises :class:`OSError`
    from this call rather than silently logging in the background.
    Callers (sandbox-activate paths) propagate this exception so
    the helper aborts rather than running with no egress isolation.
    This is the load-bearing defense against same-host port-squat
    MITM — without it, a port-bind race would result in the
    helper's HTTP traffic flowing through an attacker's listener.

        listener is bound and accepting. Callers that need to
        synchronize with relay readiness (e.g. tests) ``wait()``
        on it; production callers can discard it.

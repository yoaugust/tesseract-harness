"""Async MITM HTTP(S) proxy with egress rule enforcement.

The proxy intercepts HTTP and HTTPS traffic from the sandboxed helper,
checks each request against the configured :class:`EgressRule` list,
and either forwards or rejects with HTTP 403.

For HTTPS, the proxy performs a TLS man-in-the-middle using per-host
certificates signed by the CA from :mod:`~omnigent.inner.egress.ca`.

The proxy listens on a Unix socket (for hard enforcement via network
namespace isolation) and/or a TCP port (for soft enforcement or
testing).

Lifecycle::

    proxy = EgressProxy(rules, ca_cert_path, ca_key_path)
    port = await proxy.start_tcp()
    # OR
    await proxy.start_unix(socket_path)

    :param ca_cert_path: Path to the MITM CA certificate PEM.
    :param ca_key_path: Path to the MITM CA private key PEM.
    :param upstream_ca_bundle: Optional path to a CA bundle for
        verifying upstream TLS connections. Defaults to system CAs.
        This file is read EXACTLY ONCE here in ``__init__`` to build
        :attr:`_upstream_ssl_ctx`; it is NOT re-read per request. It
        therefore MUST be a host-side path the sandboxed agent cannot
        write — the controller passes the immutable bundle under
        ``~/.cache/omnigent-egress`` (never mounted into the sandbox),
        NOT the agent-writable scratch copy used for the in-sandbox
        ``SSL_CERT_FILE``. Passing a sandbox-writable path here would
        let the agent append its own CA (MITM of relayed upstream TLS)
        or truncate it (self-DoS).
    :param block_private_destinations: When ``True`` (the default),
        the proxy resolves the upstream host before opening the TCP
        connection and refuses to connect when any resolved IP is
        not globally routable (catches RFC1918, loopback, link-local,
        IPv6 ULA, CGNAT / RFC6598, IETF reserved blocks, TEST-NETs,
        benchmark range, multicast) or belongs to a known
        cloud-provider "trap" endpoint (see ``_CLOUD_TRAP_NETWORKS``,
        which currently lists Azure WireServer ``168.63.129.16`` —
        a public-looking IP that Azure routes only inside the
        tenant). Defends against DNS-rebinding attacks where the
        agent uses a permissive wildcard rule with a domain it
        controls that resolves to ``127.0.0.1`` (parent localhost
        services), ``10.x`` (VPC internals), ``169.254.169.254``
        (cloud IMDS), ``100.100.100.200`` (Alibaba IMDS), or
        ``168.63.129.16`` (Azure WireServer). Set to ``False`` for
        agents that legitimately reach intranet endpoints — wired
        through ``OSEnvSandboxSpec.egress_allow_private_destinations``
        so the opt-in is auditable in the spec.
    :param auth_token: When set, every inbound proxy connection MUST
        carry ``Proxy-Authorization: Basic base64("omnigent:<token>")``
        or it is rejected with ``407 Proxy Authentication Required``.
        Defends against same-UID cross-helper abuse on platforms
        without per-process network isolation (macOS ``darwin_seatbelt``
        — Linux ``bwrap`` is already protected by its own network
        namespace). The token is delivered to the helper via an
        inherited pipe file descriptor (see
        :func:`omnigent.inner.os_env._HelperProcessClient.
        _start_egress_proxy_locked`) and injected into the helper's
        ``HTTP_PROXY`` / ``HTTPS_PROXY`` env vars **in-process**
        after exec, so the token never appears in the execve-time
        kernel snapshot read by ``ps -E`` / ``sysctl
        KERN_PROCARGS2``. The header is stripped before forwarding
        upstream (``Proxy-Authorization`` is hop-by-hop per RFC 7235
        but be paranoid). ``None`` (the default) disables the check.
    :param credential_rewrites: Optional host-scoped real-credential
        rules. By default (swap-on-access) the proxy attaches the real
        credential to a bound-host request that carries no
        ``Authorization`` header — nothing credential-shaped ever enters
        the sandbox. A rule whose entry opted into ``inject_env`` also
        carries a synthetic placeholder; the proxy swaps that placeholder
        for the real secret and rejects the same placeholder sent to any
        other host with ``403`` (the cross-host leak guard).

        Raises :exc:`PermissionError` if any resolved address is
        non-globally-routable, multicast, or matches a known CSP
        "trap" endpoint.

        Uses ``ipaddress.ip_address(...).is_global`` rather than the
        narrower ``is_private`` flag so the check picks up CGNAT /
        RFC 6598 (``100.64.0.0/10``) — notably Alibaba Cloud's IMDS
        at ``100.100.100.200`` — in addition to the usual private,
        loopback, link-local, ULA, reserved, and TEST-NET blocks
        ``is_private`` already covers. Multicast (``224.0.0.0/4`` /
        ``ff00::/8``) is still marked ``is_global=True`` by Python,
        so it's checked separately.

        Cloud "trap" endpoints (``_CLOUD_TRAP_NETWORKS``) are public-
        looking IPs that vendors route only inside their own tenant
        — currently just Azure WireServer ``168.63.129.16``. These
        leak metadata and serve as cloud-host control planes, so
        they're refused regardless of ``is_global``.

        **Fail closed + pin the IP (DNS-rebinding defense).** This
        method resolves the host ONCE and returns the validated IP so
        the caller connects to that exact address instead of letting
        ``asyncio.open_connection`` perform an independent second
        lookup. Without pinning, the check and the connect are two
        separate resolutions (check-then-use / TOCTOU): an attacker
        who controls DNS for an allowed/wildcard host could fail the
        first lookup and return a private IP on the second, slipping
        past the guard. A DNS resolution failure (``socket.gaierror``)
        or an empty result therefore raises :exc:`PermissionError`
        (fail closed) rather than allowing the connect to proceed.

        :param host: Upstream hostname or IP literal to resolve and
            validate, e.g. ``"api.example.com"`` or ``"203.0.113.7"``.
        :param port: Upstream TCP port, e.g. ``443``. Passed to
            ``getaddrinfo`` to select the service.
        :returns: The validated IP string the caller must connect to
            (e.g. ``"203.0.113.7"``) when blocking is enabled, or

            ``False`` (caller connects to the hostname directly).
        :raises PermissionError: when blocking is enabled and the

          request carries no ``Authorization`` header, the proxy injects
          ``Authorization: <scheme> <real>`` on the way out. The sandbox

          is unknown or bound to a *different* host is rejected with
          ``403`` — the cross-host leak guard for a compromised sandbox.

        A non-synthetic ``Authorization`` header the client set itself is
        left untouched (and suppresses injection), so the proxy never
        clobbers an unrelated credential a tool deliberately sent.

        the sandbox, and neither verb can legitimately carry a bound-host

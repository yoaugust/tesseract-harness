"""
Backend-agnostic cwd dotfile / escaping-symlink walker.

Both spawn-time sandbox backends (``linux_bwrap`` and
``darwin_seatbelt``) need to identify the same set of cwd entries
that must be hidden from the sandboxed helper:

1. **Hidden entries** — any file/directory whose basename starts with
   ``.`` and is NOT in the spec's ``cwd_allow_hidden`` allowlist.
2. **Escaping symlinks** — any symlink (at any depth) whose target
   resolves outside the set of paths the sandbox already exposes.

The two backends emit different tokens for the same masked path
(``--bind /dev/null`` / ``--tmpfs`` for bwrap, ``(deny file-*)``
expressions for Seatbelt), but the *decision* of which paths to mask
is identical. Centralising the walker here guarantees both backends
hide exactly the same set of entries; only the emit shape differs.

Recursion is controlled by the ``recursive`` flag, which defaults to
``False`` (top-level-only) — the same default as the spec key
``cwd_hidden_scan_recursive`` that every sandbox backend threads
through, so the walker and the product agree on one default. Set it
to ``True`` (spec: ``cwd_hidden_scan_recursive: true``) to walk the
whole tree.

Top-level-only is the scalable default for medium/large projects: it
still masks the credential-shaped dotfiles that live at the root of
``cwd`` / ``$HOME`` (``.git``, ``.env``, ``.aws``, ``.ssh``, ...)
without paying to walk the whole tree. Deeply nested dotfiles are left
visible in that mode; enable recursion for untrusted trees.

The walker also implements the bounded-traversal contract:

- ``cwd_hidden_scan_max_entries`` caps how many filesystem entries
  the recursive walk is allowed to visit. Realistic projects fit well
  under the default (50000) because the walker prunes at masked
  dot-directories (``.git/`` doesn't have its tens of thousands of
  objects counted toward the cap once ``.git`` itself is masked).
- ``cwd_hidden_scan_overflow`` chooses behaviour when the cap is hit:

  - ``"warn"`` (default): emit a logging warning, stop scanning, and
    return the partial mask built up so far. Dotfiles past the cap
    remain visible. This is the default because heavy-but-trusted
    trees (anything carrying ``node_modules``) routinely exceed the
    cap, and blocking every spawn is worse than a best-effort mask
    for the common case. Pair with the deprioritization below so the
    visible-past-the-cap entries are the least-sensitive ones.
  - ``"error"``: raise :class:`OSError` with an actionable message
    naming both spec keys the user can tune. Fail-Loud — the right
    pick for untrusted source trees.
  - ``"unlimited"``: ignore the cap and walk the full tree. O(N) on
    total entries; safe but can be slow on huge monorepos.

Deprioritized directories
-------------------------

Directory subtrees whose basename is in ``deprioritize_names``
(default: ``node_modules``, ``.venv``, ``.mypy_cache``,
``.codex-tmp``) are walked **last**. The dot-prefixed ones only ever
get walked when they're on ``allow_hidden`` — otherwise they're
masked and pruned, so deprioritizing them is a no-op until allowed.
They are large and
rarely carry the project's own secrets, yet every file in them counts
toward the cap. Deferring them means the cap budget is spent masking
the project's real dotfiles first; if the cap trips, the unscanned
remainder is the deprioritized tree (the least-bad thing to leave
unmasked) rather than a project ``.env``.

When the cap is hit, the overflow message (warn log line and ``error``
exception alike) names the directories the walk did not finish —
distinguishing the one directory it was mid-scan of ("partially
scanned") from those it never reached ("not scanned"), and flagging
the deprioritized ones — so an operator can tell at a glance that, for
example, ``node_modules`` was the part left unmasked. The list is
bounded (see :data:`_MAX_UNFINISHED_DIRS_REPORTED`) so a pathological
tree can't produce a multi-KB log line.

    Walk *cwd* and identify entries that must be masked from the helper.

    Iterative DFS over *cwd* with early termination at masked
    dot-directories (the walker never descends into something it just
    marked for masking). For each entry it visits, the entry is masked
    when EITHER:

    - the basename starts with ``.`` and is not in *allow_hidden*, OR
    - the entry is a symlink whose resolved target lies outside every
      path in *safe_roots*.

    The explicit ``"*"`` allowlist entry disables dotpath masking for
    trusted roots. Escaping symlinks remain masked.

    Walker termination is deterministic:

    - ``follow_symlinks=False`` on the recursion check ensures
      symlink loops can't cause infinite descent.
    - Masked dot-directories are pruned (we don't push their
      children onto the work stack), so masking ``.git`` doesn't
      cost an entry per ``.git/objects/...`` blob.

    Directories whose basename is in *deprioritize_names* (default:
    :data:`_DEFAULT_DEPRIORITIZED_DIRS` — ``node_modules``, ``.venv``,
    ``.mypy_cache``, ``.codex-tmp``) are deferred and walked only after
    every other directory has been processed, so the cap budget masks
    the real project tree first. They are still walked — and their
    dotfiles still masked — when budget remains; they are simply last
    in line. Nested deprioritized dirs are re-deferred on each drain, which
    still terminates.

    :param cwd: Absolute, resolved-without-strict path of the
        helper's working directory. The walk starts here. Must be a
        real directory; if it isn't, the function returns an empty
        list without raising (the backend wraps the missing dir at
        spawn time and gets the kernel error message).
    :param allow_hidden: Dotfile/dotdir basenames that pass through
        unmasked at any depth, e.g. ``[".venv"]``. Matched by
        basename, so ``".venv"`` exempts both ``cwd/.venv`` and
        ``cwd/services/api/.venv``. Pass an empty sequence to mask
        every dotfile.
    :param safe_roots: Paths the sandbox already exposes (typically
        ``cwd``, the backend's default mounts, the policy's read /
        write roots). A symlink whose resolved target lies inside
        any of these is considered safe and not masked. The backend
        is responsible for assembling this list — bwrap and Seatbelt
        expose different system paths.
    :param max_entries: Cap on the number of filesystem entries the
        walker may visit. The walker counts every child returned by
        :func:`os.scandir`, masked or not. Set to a large value
        (e.g. ``2**31``) together with ``overflow="unlimited"`` to
        disable the cap.
    :param overflow: One of ``"error"``, ``"warn"``, ``"unlimited"``.
        See module docstring for per-mode semantics.
    :param recursive: Whether to descend into subdirectories. Defaults
        to ``False`` (top-level-only), matching the spec key
        ``cwd_hidden_scan_recursive`` that every backend passes
        through. When ``False`` the walker scans only the immediate
        children of *cwd* — the top-level dotfile / escaping-symlink
        checks still run, but a dotfile nested below the top level
        (e.g. ``cwd/src/config/.env``) is NOT masked, and the entry
        cap and deprioritization machinery are effectively no-ops
        because no subtree is ever queued. Pass ``True`` to walk the
        whole tree.
    :param logger_name: Logger name used for the warn-mode warning
        message. ``None`` falls back to this module's logger; backends
        pass their own logger name so the warning surfaces under the
        backend's logging namespace (matches the bwrap docstring
        promise that the warning lives under
        ``omnigent.inner.bwrap_sandbox``).
    :param scope_label: Short label used in overflow log / error
        messages to identify what the walker was scanning. Defaults
        to ``"cwd"`` for backwards compatibility; backends that
        re-use the walker for ``read_paths`` roots pass e.g.
        ``"read_paths"`` so the operator-visible message says
        ``"read_paths dotfile scan"`` rather than the misleading
        ``"cwd dotfile scan"``.
    :param deprioritize_names: Directory basenames whose subtrees are
        walked last; defaults to :data:`_DEFAULT_DEPRIORITIZED_DIRS`
        (``node_modules``, ``.venv``, ``.mypy_cache``, ``.codex-tmp``).
        Matched by basename at any depth. Dot-prefixed entries only
        take effect when also on *allow_hidden* (otherwise the dir is
        masked and pruned before this is consulted). Pass an empty
        sequence to walk in plain DFS order with no deprioritization.
    :returns: A list of :class:`MaskedEntry`. Empty when *cwd* has
        nothing worth masking or when *cwd* is not a directory.
    :raises OSError: When the cap is reached and *overflow* is
        ``"error"``. The message names both tunable spec keys plus the
        directories the walk did not finish (partially- vs not-scanned,
        deprioritized flagged) so a user hitting the cap can find the
        escape hatches and the culprit without re-reading source.

    """
    Merge the extra roots a backend must mask-scan (beyond *cwd*) into
    one deduplicated, ancestor-first list.

    Every supplied list — e.g. ``read_paths`` then ``write_paths`` — is
    folded together so a path granted by more than one lever is walked
    once, not once per lever. A root is always dropped when it is *cwd*
    or lives under *cwd*: the caller scans *cwd* itself, so that subtree
    is covered (this predates the ``write_paths`` extension).

    A root is also dropped when it is at or under any *skip_roots* entry.
    ``skip_roots`` carries the framework's own scratch / runtime write
    roots (see
    :attr:`~omnigent.inner.sandbox.SandboxPolicy.mask_scan_skip_roots`):
    they hold sandbox scaffolding — the egress ``.egress.sock``, CA
    bundle, credential-proxy files — not pre-existing user secrets, so
    scanning them is pointless and masking their dotfiles breaks the
    sandbox's own machinery.

    Whether a *granted* root nested under ANOTHER kept grant is dropped
    depends on *recursive* — and getting this wrong un-masks secrets:

    - ``recursive=True``: a kept root's walk descends its whole subtree,
      so a grant nested under it is redundant and dropped.
    - ``recursive=False`` (the default; see
      :attr:`~omnigent.inner.datamodel.OSEnvSandboxSpec.cwd_hidden_scan_recursive`):
      each walk masks only a root's IMMEDIATE children, so a parent walk
      never reaches ``parent/deep/nested/.env``. Dropping the nested
      grant would leave its top-level dotfiles visible. In this mode we
      therefore keep every distinct granted root and drop only EXACT
      duplicates.

    Kept roots are returned outermost-first, so a parent is always
    yielded before any descendant.

    :param cwd: The working directory the caller scans separately.
    :param root_lists: One or more lists of roots (``None`` entries and
        empty lists are ignored). Order between lists matters only for
        stability — the dedup result is the same set either way.
    :param recursive: Whether the backend walks each root recursively.
        Must match ``cwd_hidden_scan_recursive`` so the nested-grant
        drop only fires when a parent walk actually covers the child.
    :param skip_roots: Framework write roots to exclude entirely. A
        candidate at or under any of these is dropped from the scan.
    :returns: The roots to walk, deduplicated and ordered outermost-first.

"""Shared subagent-routing decision logic for harness hooks.

Stdlib-only on purpose (bar the equally light
:mod:`omnigent.models.claude_model_vocabulary`): the Claude-native hook runs as
a per-spawn subprocess (``python -I -m
omnigent.inner.hook_scripts.claude_router_hook``) and blocks the spawn,
so importing anything heavier would show up as spawn latency. The
claude-agent-sdk executor imports the same functions for its in-process
``PreToolUse`` callback, so both paths map decisions identically.

The runner advertises its ``route-subagent`` endpoint by writing
``subagent_router.json`` (``{"url": ..., "token": ..., "pid": ...}``) into
the session bridge directory. A missing, malformed, non-loopback or
dead-pid advertisement means the router is unreachable: the hook allows
the spawn unchanged and emits nothing.

Every ``explicit-any`` type-ignore below marks the same thing — hook
payloads, request bodies and hook outputs are untrusted JSON with no
schema this process can import — so the per-site justifications are
omitted.

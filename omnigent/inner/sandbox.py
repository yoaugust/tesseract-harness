@dataclass
class SandboxPolicy:
    """
    Resolved sandbox policy serialized between the parent and helper.

    :param backend_type: The :attr:`SandboxBackend.type_name` of the
        backend that produced this policy, e.g. ``"linux_bwrap"``,
        ``"darwin_seatbelt"``, or ``"none"``.
    :param active: Whether the helper should run any sandbox activation
        for this policy. ``False`` for the ``"none"`` backend.
    :param read_roots: Per-spec read-only allow-list, or ``None`` when
        reads are unrestricted by the policy. The bwrap backend treats
        each entry as an extra ``--ro-bind-try`` mount on top of the
        hermetic root.
    :param write_roots: Directories the helper may write into, e.g.
        the cwd plus the per-helper scratch tmpdir.
    :param write_files: Per-file write grants for non-directory paths
        that can't live in :attr:`write_roots` (bwrap treats these as
        additional ``--bind-try`` mounts).
    :param allow_network: ``True`` to share the host network namespace,
        ``False`` to isolate (bwrap adds ``--unshare-net``).
    :param cwd_allow_hidden: List of dotfile / dotdir basenames that
        pass through the sandbox view at any depth under cwd. ``"*"``
        explicitly allows every dotpath while retaining symlink escape
        masking. ``None`` lets the backend apply its default.
    :param cwd_hidden_scan_max_entries: Cap on entries the bwrap
        backend's recursive cwd walker visits. Ignored by other
        backends. Pair with :attr:`cwd_hidden_scan_overflow` to
        control behaviour when the cap is reached.
    :param cwd_hidden_scan_overflow: One of ``"error"``, ``"warn"``,
        or ``"unlimited"``. See :class:`OSEnvSandboxSpec` for the
        per-mode semantics.
    :param cwd_hidden_scan_recursive: When ``False`` (default) the
        dotfile / escaping-symlink masker scans only the top level of
        cwd and each read root; when ``True`` it recurses the full
        tree. See :class:`OSEnvSandboxSpec` for the security
        trade-off.
    :param mask_paths: Explicit files/directories the helper must not
        see, resolved to absolute paths by the backend. Masked with
        the same emit shape as the dotfile walker's entries (empty
        dir / empty file). ``None`` means no explicit masks.
    :param env_passthrough: User-declared environment-variable names
        the helper subprocess is allowed to inherit beyond the
        always-passed minimal default
        (:data:`omnigent.inner.os_env._DEFAULT_ENV_PASSTHROUGH`).
        Carried on the policy so every backend that spawns the
        helper applies the same allowlist; the parent-side
        :func:`omnigent.inner.os_env.build_helper_env` reads
        this and strips everything else from the helper's environment
        before ``subprocess.Popen``. ``None`` is treated identically
        to an empty list ("only the defaults pass through").
    :param spawn_env_allowlist: Exact environment-variable names the
        spawning executor deliberately included in the launcher
        subprocess's ``env=``. When set, :func:`run_launcher` prunes
        its inherited environment down to these names (plus internal
        launcher markers) before wrapping / exec-ing the target, so a
        spawn site that regresses to inheriting the full host
        environment cannot leak it into the sandbox.
        ``None`` (the default) skips the prune for spawn sites that
        haven't opted in.
    :param egress_relay_port: TCP port the in-namespace relay listens
        on (loopback). Set when ``egress_rules`` is active; the helper
        starts a relay daemon on this port at activation time. C1
        hardening: chosen as a random ephemeral port per helper by
        the parent rather than a hardcoded well-known port, so a
        port-squat attacker has to race every helper start instead
        of pre-binding a single known number.
    :param egress_socket_path: Absolute path (inside the namespace) to
        the Unix socket connecting to the parent's egress proxy. The
        relay forwards all traffic through this socket.
    :param deny_unix_socket_paths: Absolute paths to AF_UNIX (pathname)
        sockets the helper must NOT be able to ``connect(2)`` to, even
        when ``allow_network`` is true. Keeps a sandboxed pane from
        reaching back to an unsandboxed control-plane server over a
        socket that lives inside a bound write root (e.g. the managed
        tmux control socket). The bwrap backend overlays
        ``--bind-try /dev/null <path>`` so the path resolves to a
        character device, not a socket, and the connect fails; the
        seatbelt backend (whose default ``allow_network=true`` emits
        ``(allow network*)``, which would otherwise permit the AF_UNIX
        connect) emits an explicit last-match deny for each path.
        ``None`` is treated identically to an empty list, e.g.
        ``[Path("/tmp/omnigent-terminal-ab12/tmux.sock")]``.
    :param mask_scan_skip_roots: Write roots the dotfile / escaping-symlink
        mask scan must skip — the framework's own scratch / runtime dirs
        added post-resolve via :func:`with_additional_write_roots`. These
        hold sandbox scaffolding (the egress ``.egress.sock``, CA bundle,
        credential-proxy files), never pre-existing user secrets, so
        scanning them is both pointless and harmful (masking
        ``.egress.sock`` breaks the egress relay). ``None`` is treated
        identically to an empty list.

    Historical note: a previous revision carried an
    ``egress_auth_token`` field shared between the parent (embedded
    as Basic auth in ``HTTP_PROXY``) and the relay (which validated
    a matching ``Proxy-Authorization`` header). That field was
    dropped — see :func:`omnigent.inner.os_env._HelperProcessClient.
    _start_egress_proxy_locked` for the rationale. The token used to
    leak through ``Popen`` argv (visible via ``ps`` to any same-UID
    process) and didn't add real protection given the relay's other
    bind-fails-loud guarantees.

    - **macOS**: ``darwin_seatbelt`` (SBPL via ``sandbox-exec``).
    - **Windows**: ``windows_jobobject`` (Job Object process-tree
      containment + resource limits; no filesystem/network isolation).

    This is a pure *platform* decision — it does **not** probe for the
    backend's binary. The default is resolved at spec **parse** time
    (e.g. :func:`omnigent.inner.loader._parse_os_env_sandbox_spec`
    and :func:`omnigent.spec.parser._parse_os_env_sandbox`) to fill
    in an absent ``type:``; parsing a YAML must not depend on whether
    the host that happens to be loading it has ``bwrap`` installed
    (CI nodes, dev laptops, and the runtime host can all differ).

    Fail-loud is preserved, but at the layer that actually matters:
    when the chosen backend is resolved at **run** time and its binary
    is missing, the backend raises (see
    :meth:`omnigent.inner.bwrap_sandbox.BwrapSandboxBackend.resolve`,
    which errors with an install hint when ``bwrap`` is not on
    ``PATH``). So an agent that omitted ``sandbox.type`` on a host with
    no usable mechanism still fails loudly rather than silently running
    unsandboxed — it just fails when the sandbox is built, not when the
    spec is parsed. The only explicit opt-out remains
    ``os_env.sandbox.type='none'``.

    Spec-self-containment is preserved: a YAML that explicitly
    declares ``sandbox.type: linux_bwrap`` still routes to the bwrap
    backend and errors loudly on macOS (the author asked for it). The
    default fires when ``sandbox:`` is omitted, when its ``type:`` is
    omitted, or when ``type: auto`` is selected explicitly.

"""Kimi Code CLI executor.

Drives Moonshot AI's upstream ``kimi`` CLI from
https://github.com/MoonshotAI/Kimi-Code (the curl-installed
single-binary build at https://code.kimi.com/kimi-code/install.sh).
The legacy pypi ``kimi-cli`` package is **not** supported — its
command-line surface (``--print``, list-of-blocks content, etc.) is
incompatible with the upstream binary the issue (#271) targets.

One ``kimi -p <prompt> --output-format stream-json`` subprocess per
Omnigent turn:

- parses each JSONL line on stdout into one or more
  :class:`ExecutorEvent` (assistant text, tool-call request, tool-call
  result, session metadata),
- captures the kimi session id from the ``role:"meta"`` /
  ``type:"session.resume_hint"`` line for resume on the next turn,
- uses the subprocess's ``cwd=`` for the working directory (upstream
  has no ``--work-dir`` flag),
- after the subprocess exits, best-effort sums the turn's ``usage.record``
  rows from kimi's persisted ``wire.jsonl`` (the stream-json stdout carries
  no usage or model records) into ``TurnComplete.usage``, stamping the
  effective model from ``llm.request``.

Kimi runs its own agent loop and its own tools (Bash, edit, read, web,
…) — Omnigent does not re-execute them. The executor advertises
``handles_tools_internally=True`` and forwards ``tool_calls`` /
``role:"tool"`` events from kimi's transcript as informational
:class:`ToolCallRequest` / :class:`ToolCallComplete` so the Omnigent
UI can render them, but the Session layer does not dispatch them.

Env-var contract (read once at construction by
:mod:`omnigent.inner.kimi_harness`):

- ``HARNESS_KIMI_MODEL``: Kimi-side model id, e.g. ``"kimi-k2-turbo"``.
  ``None`` lets the kimi config's ``default_model`` win.
- ``HARNESS_KIMI_CWD``: working directory the kimi subprocess runs in.
  Upstream has no ``--work-dir`` flag so this is threaded through
  ``cwd=`` on the subprocess. ``None`` falls back to the runner's cwd.
- ``OMNIGENT_KIMI_PATH``: explicit path to the ``kimi`` binary, e.g.
  ``"/Users/x/.kimi-code/bin/kimi"``. Defaults to ``"kimi"`` looked up
  on ``PATH``. (Legacy ``HARNESS_KIMI_PATH`` still honored, deprecated.)
- ``HARNESS_KIMI_PLAN``: truthy → ``--plan`` (read-only plan mode).
- ``HARNESS_KIMI_CONTINUE_LAST``: truthy → ``--continue`` (resume the
  most recent session for the working directory). Mutually exclusive
  with ``HARNESS_KIMI_SESSION_ID``; the explicit session id wins.
- ``HARNESS_KIMI_SKILLS_DIRS``: JSON list of paths forwarded as one
  ``--skills-dir <path>`` per entry. Empty / unset = use kimi's
  default skill discovery (user + project dirs).

Per-invocation provider routing (``--config-file`` / ``--mcp-config-file``
/ gateway env vars) is **not** wired: upstream kimi has no per-spawn
config override. Provider configuration lives in ``~/.kimi-code/config.toml``
and is managed out-of-band via ``kimi provider add`` (Omnigent-side
provider injection is a deferred follow-up).

"""Cross-platform child-process spawning and tree teardown.

Historically omnigent terminated child agent processes by killing their POSIX
process group (``os.killpg``), which only works because children are spawned
with ``start_new_session=True`` so ``pid == pgid``. Neither process groups nor
``os.killpg`` exist on Windows, so this module centralizes the portable
equivalents:

* :func:`spawn_kwargs` — the ``Popen``/``create_subprocess_exec`` keyword args
  that put a child in its own group/session (so signals don't leak to the
  parent and the whole tree can be torn down).
* :func:`terminate_tree` / :func:`kill_tree` — recursively stop a process and
  all of its descendants, using the process-group fast path on POSIX and
  :mod:`psutil` walking on every platform.
* :func:`process_alive` — liveness check that doesn't rely on ``os.kill(pid, 0)``.

:mod:`psutil` is already a core dependency, so the descendant walk needs no new
package.

"""QwenExecutor: run agents through Qwen Code's ACP mode.

Spawns Qwen (``qwen --acp``) as a subprocess and communicates via the
Agent Communication Protocol (ACP) — a JSON-RPC 2.0 protocol over
newline-delimited JSON on stdin/stdout.

Protocol flow:
  1. ``initialize``  — handshake, learn capabilities.
  2. ``session/new`` — create a session, get back the server-assigned sessionId.
  3. ``session/prompt`` — send a user turn; wait for streaming
     ``session/update`` notifications and the final response.
  4. Repeat step 3 for subsequent turns (``session/load`` or just re-use the
     same sessionId if the server keeps it alive across prompts).

Qwen manages its own agent loop, tool execution, context window, and
compaction internally.  This executor translates the ACP event stream into
Omnigent ExecutorEvents.

Requirements:
    The ``qwen`` CLI (v0.18+) must be installed and on PATH.

"""Deny-by-default environment filtering for agent-CLI subprocesses.

Every harness spawns a vendor CLI as a child process. Handing it
``os.environ`` hands it every secret on the host — cloud tokens, other
providers' API keys — whether or not a sandbox wraps the process afterwards.

The pi and codex executors already filtered; five siblings did not
(omnigent-ai/omnigent#3445). This is the shared implementation so the next
harness added is filtered by construction rather than by remembering.

The model is not "no credentials ever". It is:

    shared safe base  +  this harness's own config/provider families
                      +  whatever the spec declared in
                         ``os_env.sandbox.env_passthrough``

so a harness still sees the variables it legitimately authenticates with,
and stops seeing every *other* provider's.

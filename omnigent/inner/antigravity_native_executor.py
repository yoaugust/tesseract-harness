"""Executor that delivers Omnigent web/mobile turns into a native Antigravity agy.

``omnigent antigravity`` runs the Antigravity ``agy`` CLI in a runner-owned tmux
terminal and mirrors its transcript into the Omnigent session via the RPC read
driver (the read path). This executor is the **write path**: when a turn is
submitted from the Omnigent web/mobile UI it delivers the user's message by
TYPING IT INTO the agy TUI pane over tmux
(:func:`omnigent.harnesses.antigravity_native.bridge.inject_user_message_via_tui`), exactly
like the **claude**/**codex** native bridges drive their vendor panes. agy then
runs a real model turn and its reply flows back through the read driver.

**Why typing into the TUI, not headless ``SendUserCascadeMessage`` RPC
(#1156/#1158).** Typing into the TUI gives true parity with claude/codex native:
the turn RENDERS in the agy TUI AND lands on the SAME cascade the TUI displays,
so the agy TUI and the Omnigent web mirror share ONE conversation in both
directions. The prior headless RPC path delivered onto a separate
``StartCascade`` cascade the TUI never showed — so the agy TUI never echoed web
turns (#1156) and TUI-typed turns never mirrored to the web (#1158). agy records
a TUI-typed turn as a real ``CORTEX_STEP_TYPE_USER_INPUT`` step (what the read
driver keys on); the careful inject (draft-clear + bracketed paste +
footer-verified submit) handles the attended-TUI race. RPC remains the
read/control transport only (``StreamAgentStateUpdates`` /
``GetAllCascadeTrajectories`` / ``CancelCascadeSteps`` /
``HandleCascadeUserInteraction``). The same path serves mid-turn steering.

Because agy owns its own model loop and emits output via the read path, this
executor:

* does NOT stream (``supports_streaming() -> False``) — the read driver posts the
  assistant message;
* yields a single :class:`TurnComplete` with ``response=None`` on a successful
  send (fabricating text here would double the read driver's mirrored message);
* supports a live message queue (``supports_live_message_queue() -> True``) — a
  mid-turn web message is delivered over the same RPC, which is how web steering
  works.

**Per-turn model (the load-bearing detail).** ``SendUserCascadeMessage`` REQUIRES
a ``planModel`` enum per turn (omitting it errors "neither PlanModel nor
RequestedModel specified"), and the enum names are version-volatile so they are
NEVER hardcoded. The executor resolves the model at runtime in two tiers
(design §10.4): (1) echo agy's CURRENT model from the latest ``USER_INPUT`` step's
``userInput.userConfig.plannerConfig.planModel`` (a string on the live wire, with
the older ``requestedModel.model`` shape as a fallback) reflecting the user's TUI
``/model`` choice without new plumbing; (2) on a first turn / when no
prior model is observable, fall back to the ``recommended`` entry from
``GetAvailableModels``. The Omnigent ``ExecutorConfig.model``/``reasoning_effort``
stay informational on this write path — agy's own model selection determines the
turn's model and thinking budget and cannot be overridden from here.

Attachment note: the RPC turn text takes plain text, so an image/file attachment
on a web turn is materialized to a file under the bridge dir and referenced by
absolute path (``[Attached: <path>]``) so agy can open it with its Read tool —
mirroring cursor-native. Any prose the user typed is sent alongside the marker.

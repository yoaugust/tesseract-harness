    (``exit-empty on`` + ``remain-on-exit off``) the instant that CLI exits —
    a crash, ``/exit``, or an environment-specific early exit (issue #540: a
    claude-native sub-agent on WSL2 that renders its prompt then exits) — the

    Build tmux options for scrollback and pane input behavior.

    copy-mode selections without trusting pane OSC 52 requests. ``mouse on``
    is what lets a native ``tmux attach`` client reach the pane's scrollback:
    tmux's default ``WheelUpPane`` binding forwards the wheel to the pane when
    it is on the alternate screen or tracking the mouse, and only scrolls tmux
    history for the inline CLIs that ignore it. The cost is that click-drag
    selection on such a pane goes through tmux copy mode (which exports to the
    attached terminal via ``set-clipboard``) rather than the terminal's own
    selection, so native selection uses its Shift/Option-drag override.

    focus changes. ``extended-keys`` with CSI-u formatting

    as Shift+Enter when the attached terminal supports them. Terminals

        Start a daemon thread driving idle/activity edges from the pane.

        Thread-based sibling of :meth:`start_idle_watcher` for callers
        without a long-lived event loop. The Omnigent ``sys_terminal_launch``
        path runs ``SysTerminalLaunchTool.invoke`` on a worker thread
        and drives :meth:`launch` via ``asyncio.run`` per call — that
        loop exits the moment ``launch`` returns, so an asyncio task
        started inside it dies. A daemon thread polling tmux via
        ``subprocess.run`` survives across launch / send / read tool
        calls and stops on :meth:`close` (or when the host process
        exits, since it's a daemon).

        Edge-triggered: ``on_idle`` fires once per idle transition (re-
        arms only after new output mutates the pane); ``on_activity``
        fires on every poll tick where the pane content changed — so at
        most once per *poll_interval_s*, which for the fast claude-native
        watcher (200ms) is up to ~5/sec while a pane redraws continuously.
        ``on_exit`` fires once when the tmux session disappears unexpectedly.
        Any further rate-limiting of activity (e.g. the runner's
        one-pulse-per-second ``session.terminal.activity`` throttle) is
        the caller's responsibility, not this watcher's. At least one
        callback should be provided; passing several is fine.

        :param on_idle: Optional sync callback invoked once per idle
            edge, or ``None`` to skip idle detection. Must not block the
            polling thread for long — invoked synchronously between
            snapshots.
        :param on_activity: Optional sync callback invoked on each tick
            the pane changed (the runner-determined "PTY had output"
            signal). Same non-blocking contract as *on_idle*.
        :param on_exit: Optional sync callback invoked when the watcher
            observes that tmux has disappeared. Same non-blocking contract
            as *on_idle*.
        :param on_tick: Optional sync callback invoked once per poll tick
            (after the exit check, before the pane diff), regardless of
            whether the pane changed. Lets a caller drive an out-of-band
            status source — e.g. the claude-native watcher reading Claude's
            ``sessions/<pid>.json`` — on the same cadence without a second

            :data:`_IDLE_POLL_INTERVAL_SECONDS`.

            so callbacks can be rebound after terminal ownership transfer.

    :param parent_os_env_spec: The parent session's os_env spec, used
        when the terminal spec itself has no ``os_env`` and should

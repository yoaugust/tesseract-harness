"""Per-session ``KIMI_CODE_HOME`` builder that injects Omnigent hooks.

Kimi Code reads a single ``config.toml`` at ``$KIMI_CODE_HOME/config.toml``
(default ``~/.kimi-code``) and stores its auth (``oauth/`` + ``credentials/``)
relative to the same home — there is no project-level merge for the ``hooks``
array. To gate a session's tools without mutating the user's global config, the
runner points the launched ``kimi`` process at a session-scoped home that:

- symlinks the user's global home entries (oauth, credentials, …) so login /
  providers keep working — EXCEPT the ``sessions/`` store and its index, which
  stay session-private so the transcript forwarder's wire-log discovery can
  never adopt a parallel session's log — and
- carries a ``config.toml`` that is the user's config text with two Omnigent
  ``[[hooks]]`` appended — a ``PreToolUse`` deny-gate and a ``PermissionRequest``
  read-only surface, both dispatched to :mod:`omnigent.harnesses.kimi_native.hook`.

Appending as text (rather than parsing + re-emitting TOML) keeps the user's
config byte-for-byte and needs no TOML writer: a trailing ``[[hooks]]`` table
array is always valid regardless of what section preceded it.

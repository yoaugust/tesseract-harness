"""Mirror a kimi-native TUI session's transcript into the Omnigent web chat.

The kimi-native harness launches the interactive ``kimi`` TUI in a tmux pane and
injects web-UI turns into it (see :mod:`omnigent.harnesses.kimi_native.bridge`). The TUI's
reply renders live in the embedded terminal, but — unlike the SDK ``KimiExecutor``
— nothing flows the assistant's response back into Omnigent's conversation
transcript (the chat bubbles). This module closes that gap, the kimi analog of
:mod:`omnigent.harnesses.cursor_native.forwarder`.

Data source: kimi persists each session to an append-only JSONL "wire" log at
``$KIMI_CODE_HOME/sessions/<wd_…>/<session_…>/agents/main/wire.jsonl``. The
native harness points ``KIMI_CODE_HOME`` at ``<bridge_dir>/kimi-code-home`` whose
``sessions/`` store is session-private (see
:mod:`omnigent.kimi_native_credentials`), so discovery only ever sees this
session's own wire logs; ``workDir`` (via ``session_index.jsonl``) and recency
narrow it further. Relevant wire events:

- ``{"type": "turn.prompt", "input": [{"type":"text","text":…}], "origin": {"kind":"user"}}``
  → a user message.
- ``{"type": "context.append_loop_event", "event": {"type": "content.part",
  "part": {"type": "text", "text": …}, "uuid": …}}`` → an assistant message.
  (``part.type == "think"`` is reasoning, mirrored as a transient
  ``external_output_reasoning_delta`` from ``part["think"]``; ``tool.call`` /
  ``tool.result`` events are never posted — the embedded terminal shows them —
  but are tracked so a long-running tool doesn't look like an orphaned turn.)
- ``{"type": "turn.ended", "reason": "completed" | "failed" | "cancelled", …}``
  → the authoritative terminal record for a turn. Failed and cancelled turns
  emit no ``step.end`` at all (see ``tests/fixtures/kimi_wire``), so ``step.end``
  finish reasons are never treated as turn edges.
- ``{"type": "usage.record", "model": …, "usage": {"inputOther", "output",
  "inputCacheRead", "inputCacheCreation"}, "usageScope": "turn"}`` → token
  usage for one LLM call. Accumulated into per-session cumulative totals and
  POSTed as coalesced ``external_session_usage`` events. Kimi emits no
  monetary data, so the forwarder prices the totals itself as a sum over
  per-model segments (``cumulative_cost_usd``); when a segment's model has
  no resolvable pricing the cost is omitted and the server falls back to
  pricing the token totals at the current model.
- ``{"type": "llm.request", "model": …, "modelAlias": …}`` → the effective
  model (the provider-resolved id, falling back to the configured alias).
  Mirrored as a deduped ``external_model_change`` so the cost gate and the
  web model picker see the real model — never seeded at spawn (the codex
  pattern: the spawn model must land in ``model_override`` too).

Each mirrored turn is POSTed as an ``external_conversation_item`` to
``/v1/sessions/{id}/events`` (the same shape :mod:`omnigent.harnesses.kimi_native.hook`
uses for its read-only approval surface). A per-session byte offset (plus the
line count that keys stable response ids) is persisted in
``<bridge_dir>/kimi_forwarder.json`` so restarts resume without double-posting
and each poll reads only the log's new tail.

    The kimi analog of codex-native's ``_SessionUsageCoalescer`` +

    cumulative (SET-semantics) session totals posted as coalesced
    ``external_session_usage`` events with the model riding along on every
    post. Kimi emits no monetary data, so the totals are also split per
    effective model and priced client-side as a sum over segments
    (``cumulative_cost_usd`` — see :meth:`_cumulative_cost`), keeping cost
    correct across mid-session model switches under the server's monotonic
    clamp. ``llm.request`` rows mirror the effective model as a
    deduped ``external_model_change``; the baseline is never seeded at spawn,
    so the real spawn model lands in ``model_override`` for the cost gate.

    Every post is best-effort: a failure is logged and swallowed so usage
    mirroring can never stall transcript forwarding. Failed posts are NOT
    lost: :meth:`sync` runs on every poll and re-posts whatever still differs
    from the last successfully delivered payload/model, so a turn-final
    failure retries even when no further wire records ever arrive.

    Cumulative usage/model state is persisted to ``_USAGE_STATE_FILE`` so
    forwarder restarts and terminal recreation resume the counters. Design
    ruling: persistence never gates the shared wire cursor — transcript
    liveness wins over usage durability. A failed persist keeps the totals
    in memory (the per-poll sync retries the write); a crash while the
    bridge dir is unwritable undercounts by the delta since the last
    successful persist, which is clamp-safe and mirrors the stateless
    claude/codex forwarder trust model.

    Besides mirroring, this owns the session's turn-status edges: the top-level
    ``turn.ended`` wire record posts idle (completed/cancelled) or failed; a
    dead kimi pane mid-turn posts failed; a turn whose wire has been quiet

    tool hung), so a crashed or wedged kimi never strands the session
    'running'. The turn lifecycle is persisted alongside the tail cursor, so
    the fallbacks stay armed across a forwarder restart mid-turn.

        bearer-token expiry (mirrors the qwen forwarder).

"""Launch-config helpers for native Antigravity (agy) TUI sessions.

This module assembles the ``agy`` command-line arguments and environment
overrides needed to start or resume a native agy session.  It contains only
pure functions and a frozen dataclass — no live agy calls are made here.

Key design points:

* **Auth inheritance** — agy shares ``~/.gemini`` with the user's interactive
  login; no credential seeding is required.  :func:`resolve_native_antigravity_launch`
  verifies (informational only) that a credential exists but always returns
  ``subscription`` mode regardless.

* **Per-session identity is discovered, not assigned** — agy mints its own UUID
  conversation and ignores the ``ANTIGRAVITY_CONVERSATION_ID`` env var
  (verified empirically; see ``docs/claude/antigravity-spike-findings.md``). A
  fresh session therefore sets nothing for identity; the forwarder discovers
  agy's real id from the newest ``brain/<uuid>`` dir and persists it. A resume
  passes ``--conversation <id>`` with that discovered id on the command line.

* **Workspace = the agy process cwd** — agy runs its tools in its own working
  directory (verified empirically: a tmux-launched agy with ``cwd`` set to a
  project dir ran ``run_command`` with that ``Cwd``, never the default
  ``scratch`` dir). The launcher pins the terminal cwd to the session working
  directory, so no ``--add-dir`` flag is required.

* **No usable env knobs** — agy also ignores ``ANTIGRAVITY_SIDECAR_WEB_PORT``
  (it binds its own ephemeral ports) and ``ANTIGRAVITY_EXECUTABLE_DATA_DIR``
  (its conversation store stays under the default ``~/.gemini/antigravity-cli``)
  for the host process; both are sidecar-plugin-scoped no-ops. So
  :func:`build_agy_launch` emits no env overrides for a fresh session.

* **Auth is inherited** — current agy releases accept either their persisted
  Google OAuth login or ``GEMINI_API_KEY``. The isolated settings prepared by
  the bridge select the Gemini provider when the key is present.

    """Decide whether ``--dangerously-skip-permissions`` should be appended.

    agy's only pre-emptive permission control is the all-or-nothing bypass flag
    (see :data:`_SKIP_PERMISSIONS_FLAG`). The flag is appended when **either**:

    * ``permission_mode == "bypassPermissions"`` — the user/worker explicitly
      asked for full auto-approval (the truthful analogue of how
      ``claude-native`` maps ``--permission-mode bypassPermissions`` and
      ``codex-native`` maps ``--dangerously-bypass-approvals-and-sandbox``); or
    * the launch is **headless** — no interactive client will attach to answer
      agy's ``request-review`` TUI prompt, so leaving it on would hang the turn
      forever. Headless/unattended antigravity-native launches (sandbox,
      autonomous, server-spawned sub-agents) therefore auto-bypass, matching how
      the SDK/headless flavors run unattended.

    For a non-bypass, interactive (attended) launch the flag is omitted so agy's
    default ``request-review`` prompts the user per tool — answered by the
    attached TTY (CLI) or, on the host-spawned web path, surfaced as a real-time
    Omnigent elicitation by the RPC read driver's interaction bridge (see
    :mod:`omnigent.harnesses.antigravity_native.reader` /
    :mod:`omnigent.harnesses.antigravity_native.interactions`). agy exposes no firing
    pre-tool hook, so Omnigent cannot pre-empt a tool before it runs; the
    elicitation card is the honest gate.

    .. warning:: The ``headless`` argument is currently derived from the
       launching process's TTY (``_launch_is_headless`` in
       :mod:`omnigent.harnesses.antigravity_native.main`). That is sound only while
       antigravity-native is CLI-launched. If a Phase-5 server-spawn / web-attach
       launch path is added, "headless" must be redefined as "no web client
       attached" — otherwise a web-attended session would auto-bypass here. See
       the matching note on ``_launch_is_headless``.

    :param permission_mode: The session's effective Omnigent permission mode,
        e.g. ``"bypassPermissions"`` / ``"default"`` / ``"acceptEdits"``.
        ``None`` is treated as a non-bypass mode.
    :param headless: ``True`` when no interactive client will attach (sandbox /
        autonomous / server-spawned / detached launch).

    Two launch modes are supported:

    * **Fresh session** (``resume=False``) — nothing is set for identity. agy
      mints its own UUID conversation and ignores any
      ``ANTIGRAVITY_CONVERSATION_ID`` we set (verified empirically), so
      *conversation_id* is not used and the forwarder discovers agy's real id
      afterward. The ``--conversation`` flag is NOT added to argv.

    * **Resume session** (``resume=True``) — ``--conversation <id>`` is
      appended to argv so agy resumes the existing conversation. Here
      *conversation_id* MUST be agy's real (discovered) UUID, persisted from a
      prior launch; agy cannot resume the launcher's minted placeholder.

    **Permission mode → agy flag.** ``--dangerously-skip-permissions`` is
    appended when :func:`should_skip_permissions` says so — i.e. when
    ``permission_mode == "bypassPermissions"`` OR the launch is *headless*
    (no interactive client will attach to answer agy's ``request-review``
    prompt, which would otherwise hang an unattended turn). Otherwise it is
    omitted so agy's default ``request-review`` prompts the attached user. This
    is the *only* pre-emptive control agy honors; it is all-or-nothing and
    cannot be routed to the web UI or made per-tool (the genuine Omnigent policy
    gate for this harness is post-hoc/audit-only). The flag is not duplicated
    when *extra_args* already carries it.

    In both modes auth is inherited from the ambient environment / agy state,
    and the workspace is the agy process cwd (set by the terminal spec), so no
    ``--add-dir`` is emitted. No env overrides are produced: agy ignores
    ``ANTIGRAVITY_SIDECAR_WEB_PORT`` / ``ANTIGRAVITY_CONVERSATION_ID`` /
    ``ANTIGRAVITY_EXECUTABLE_DATA_DIR`` for the host process.

    :param conversation_id: agy's real conversation id to resume, e.g.
        ``"68caaeac-..."``. Required (non-``None``) when ``resume=True``;
        ignored when ``resume=False``.
    :param model: Optional model label, e.g. ``"gemini-2.5-pro"``.
        ``None`` omits ``--model`` so agy uses its default.
    :param resume: ``True`` to resume an existing conversation; ``False``
        to start a fresh one.
    :param permission_mode: The session's effective Omnigent permission mode,
        e.g. ``"bypassPermissions"``. ``None`` (the default) is a non-bypass
        mode. See :func:`should_skip_permissions`.
    :param headless: ``True`` when no interactive client will attach to the agy
        TUI (sandbox / autonomous / server-spawned / detached). Forces the
        bypass flag so agy does not hang waiting for a ``request-review``
        answer. See :func:`should_skip_permissions`.

        flags, e.g. ``("--print-timeout", "30")``.

        environment (always empty for the agy host process).

"""connect-RPC client for a running native Antigravity (agy) process.

This is the **discovery / read / control helper** for the native agy paths: the
RPC read driver (:mod:`omnigent.harnesses.antigravity_native.reader`, which polls/streams
trajectory steps to mirror agy's conversation) and the native executor
(:mod:`omnigent.inner.antigravity_native_executor`, which delivers web/mobile
turns). It provides, over agy's connect-RPC surface:

* **conversation-ownership discovery** (:func:`resolve_language_server_port` /
  :func:`get_trajectory_steps`) — the read side the reader binds to;
* **turn delivery** via ``SendUserCascadeMessage``
  (:func:`send_user_cascade_message`), which agy records as a real ``USER_INPUT``
  turn — used by the executor instead of agy's ``SendAgentMessage`` RPC (which
  agy records as a ``SYSTEM_MESSAGE``, "not actually sent by the user", and would
  never mirror as a user turn) and instead of typing into the TUI over tmux;
* **turn interrupt** via ``CancelCascadeSteps`` (:func:`cancel_cascade_steps`),
  used by the executor's interrupt path.

How agy exposes a control surface (verified end-to-end; see
``docs/claude/antigravity-sidecar-spike.md``):

* A running ``agy`` process opens **two** ephemeral ``127.0.0.1`` TCP LISTEN
  ports. The **lower** one is a TLS HTTP/2 **connect-RPC** server hosting
  ``exa.language_server_pb.LanguageServerService``; the higher one is a plain
  HTTP surface that 404s. The TLS cert is self-signed, so the client uses
  ``verify=False``.
* The ports are ephemeral and not configurable
  (``ANTIGRAVITY_SIDECAR_WEB_PORT`` is a sidecar-plugin no-op), so they are
  discovered from the loopback socket table — psutil per agy pid (cross-platform
  and already a hard dependency), falling back to ``lsof`` and then to
  ``/proc/net/tcp`` on hosts where the socket cannot be attributed to a pid.
* Ownership probe: ``POST .../GetConversationMetadata`` with REQUEST body
  ``{"conversationId": "<id>"}`` returns HTTP 200 whose RESPONSE echoes that id at
  ``metadata.rootConversationId`` for a hosted conversation, and HTTP 500
  ("trajectory not found") for an unknown one — so a caller can confirm which
  live agy owns a conversation before binding its port. (Request and response
  shapes differ: the id is sent flat as ``conversationId`` and echoed nested
  under ``metadata``.)

Port discovery is **port-first**: it enumerates candidate loopback connect-RPC
ports (see :func:`_candidate_agy_rpc_ports`) and, for each, checks whether its
server reports the target ``conversation_id`` via ``GetConversationMetadata`` —
so the right port is found even when several agy instances run. There is no pid
key: agy is launched under ``tmux_start_on_attach`` (CLI) and does not exist at
launch, and on some hosts agy's listening socket is owned by a backend that is
neither the agy pid nor ``lsof``-attributable. The conversation-ownership check
is what makes a discovered port trustworthy, rejecting a recycled/foreign port
that hosts a different agy.

Everything that touches the OS (``lsof``, process enumeration) or the network
(httpx) is funnelled through small module-level seams so the unit tests can mock
them without real subprocesses or sockets.

    The response shape (live-verified, agy 1.0.10) wraps the catalog under a

    This function unwraps that envelope and returns the inner object, so callers

    key on ``catalog["models"]``. Pick the desired entry by ``recommended ==

    Stream agent-state updates for ``conversation_id`` over connect server-stream.

    Opens a persistent ``StreamAgentStateUpdates`` POST (connect protocol,
    ``Content-Type: application/connect+json``) and yields each DATA frame's
    logical update payload as it arrives, stopping cleanly on the end-of-stream
    trailer. Each DATA frame is a connect envelope ``{"update": {...}}`` (live-
    verified, agy 1.0.10); this generator unwraps it and yields the inner
    ``update`` object, so the reader receives
    ``{"conversationId", "trajectoryId", "status", "mainTrajectoryUpdate", ...}``
    at the top level. The first frame carries a snapshot
    (``update.mainTrajectoryUpdate.stepsUpdate.steps[]``); subsequent frames are
    cumulative snapshots that grow while a step is generating (the Task T-D
    reader owns prefix-diffing for ``output_text_delta`` parity).

    Framing (live-verified, agy 1.0.10 — see design §10.2). The request body is a
    single connect-enveloped message (see :func:`_encode_connect_envelope`). The
    response is a byte stream of frames, each ``[flag: 1B][length: 4B BE][payload:
    length B]``:

    * ``flag == 0x00`` — DATA: ``payload`` is the JSON envelope ``{"update":
      {...}}``; the unwrapped ``update`` object is yielded.
    * ``flag & 0x02`` (:data:`_FRAME_FLAG_TRAILER`) — end-of-stream trailer:
      iteration stops; the payload is NOT yielded. A trailer carrying a connect
      ``{"error": {...}}`` (how a mid-stream failure is reported once the 200 +
      headers have been flushed) raises :class:`AntigravityRpcError`; an empty /
      non-error / unparseable trailer is a clean stop.
    * ``flag & 0x01`` (:data:`_FRAME_FLAG_COMPRESSED`) — compressed payload: agy
      sends uncompressed, so a set bit means a decode mismatch — raises
      :class:`AntigravityRpcError` rather than feeding compressed bytes to the
      JSON parser.

    Reassembly is buffer-based because frames can be split across network chunks
    AND several frames can arrive in one chunk: a ``bytearray`` accumulates bytes
    and, each pass, a frame is sliced out only when the buffer holds the full
    5-byte header AND the full declared payload — otherwise the loop awaits more
    bytes. One chunk is never assumed to equal one frame.

    The stream uses :data:`_STREAM_TIMEOUT` (no read deadline) because the
    long-poll idles between turns; a tight per-read timeout would abort it during
    normal think-time.

       polling. Scanning in that window returns a FOREIGN agy and durably
       cross-binds the session: the conversation is created inside another
       session's agy, the reader then adopts that agy's active cascade, and the
       user sees an existing conversation duplicated while their own agy is
       orphaned (its replies never arrive).

def conversation_id_owned_by_pid(pid: int, candidate_ids: Iterable[str]) -> str | None:
    """
    Return which candidate conversation id a specific agy pid owns.

    The deterministic counterpart to :func:`resolve_language_server_port`: that
    function answers "which port owns this *known* id"; this one answers "which
    of these candidate ids does *this* process own", binding discovery to a
    specific agy pid (e.g. the one running under this session's tmux pane).

    agy exposes no method to *list* its conversation id, only
    ``GetConversationMetadata`` which confirms a given id. So this resolves the
    pid's own connect-RPC port via :func:`discover_language_server_port` and asks
    that port to confirm each candidate (``GetConversationMetadata`` returns
    metadata only for an id that server hosts), eliminating the newest-dir guess,
    the cross-launch ambiguity, and the resulting livelock.

    Correctness over liveness, mirroring the forwarder's
    ``_discover_conversation_id``: a pid's connect-RPC server can confirm more
    than one candidate brain-dir id, so every candidate is tested and the result
    is bound only when *exactly one* matches. Zero or multiple matches return
    ``None`` (the multi-match case is refused rather than guessed, since
    first-match would depend on ``candidate_ids`` order and could bind the wrong
    transcript / external_session_id).

    On a host where ``lsof`` cannot attribute the socket to *pid* (restricted
    ``/proc``), the resolve falls back to checking the candidates against EVERY
    live agy connect-RPC port rather than just *pid*'s. Because the conversation
    id is globally unique this never mis-binds; but two concurrent same-host
    sessions sharing the HOME-global brain dir can put both their ids in
    ``candidate_ids``, in which case both are confirmed (by different ports) and
    the call refuses (returns ``None``) instead of guessing — the forwarder then
    retries. So the fallback trades the pid-scoped *liveness* of the binding for
    the same safety, never correctness. (The executor's write path,
    :func:`resolve_language_server_port`, is unaffected: it already holds the
    target conversation id, so a single port resolves unambiguously.)

       agy 1.0.8 exposes ``ForceStopCascadeTree`` / ``CancelCascadeInvocation`` /
       ``CancelCascadeSteps`` on the connect-RPC surface (method names verified in
       the binary), but the request CONTRACT is **not** verified: the proto field

       agy's per-turn identifiers, which are NOT exposed in the transcript and
       which this forwarder does not hold (it only knows the *conversation* id).
       The stop semantics are also unconfirmed against a live process. Until the
       request shape (and the cascade-id source) is verified end-to-end, this
       function does not issue an RPC: it logs and returns ``False`` so the gated
       caller treats the interrupt as unavailable and relies on the audit warning
       alone.

       TODO(antigravity-interrupt): verify ``ForceStopCascadeTreeRequest`` (does
       it accept the conversation id, or does it require a cascade id obtained
       from ``GetCascadeTrajectorySteps`` / a metadata RPC?) on a live agy, then
       implement the POST (a loopback connect-RPC call like the
       ``GetConversationMetadata`` probe above) and flip

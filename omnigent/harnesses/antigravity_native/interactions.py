"""Interaction bridge for the native Antigravity (agy) RPC harness.

This is the correctness-sensitive piece of the RPC core rework: it surfaces an
agy WAITING interaction (``ask_question`` / command ``permission``) as an
Omnigent elicitation, waits for the human's verdict, and delivers it back to agy
via ``HandleCascadeUserInteraction`` — handling agy's **WAITING-interaction
timeout gotcha** end-to-end.

The gotcha (design ``docs/antigravity-native-rpc-core-design.md`` §2.1, memory
``agy-rpc-interaction-bridge``): a WAITING interaction **times out** server-side
(→ ``CORTEX_STEP_STATUS_ERROR``), after which agy **auto-retries with a fresh
WAITING step at a HIGHER ``stepIndex``**. Omnigent elicitations wait on a human
(potentially slow), so by the time a verdict arrives the captured
``trajectoryId`` / ``stepIndex`` may be STALE. Consequences this module handles:

* The bridge **re-reads the freshest WAITING step at delivery time** and targets
  THAT step's ids — never the ones captured at detection.
* ``HTTP 500 "input not registered for step N"`` is **overloaded**: it means
  either a missing ``trajectoryId`` *or* a step that already timed out. After a
  delivery raises it, the bridge re-reads for a NEW (higher-index) WAITING step
  and re-surfaces the elicitation against it (so the retry step gets a fresh
  elicitation id and the web UI re-prompts).
* The whole loop is bounded by ``max_retries`` so a pathological retry storm
  cannot spin forever.

Seam design (so the timeout logic is unit-testable without a live agy):

* ``get_steps`` — re-reads the freshest trajectory steps (production wraps
  :func:`omnigent.harnesses.antigravity_native.rpc.get_trajectory_steps`).
* ``request_elicitation`` — publishes the elicitation under a deterministic id
  and long-poll-awaits the user's result; returns ``None`` on timeout/cancel
  (production, wired in Task 11, POSTs the
  ``antigravity-elicitation-request`` hook and long-polls — mirrors codex's
  ``_handle_codex_elicitation_request``).
* ``deliver`` — defaults to :func:`_deliver_via_rpc`, which offloads the blocking
  :func:`omnigent.harnesses.antigravity_native.rpc.handle_user_interaction` to a worker
  thread (the function is synchronous); injectable so tests don't need a live agy.
* ``inject_tui`` — defaults to :func:`_inject_via_tui`, which types the verdict's
  key sequence into the agy TUI pane AFTER the RPC delivery. The attended agy TUI
  keeps its OWN permission/question prompt open in parallel with the RPC step
  (live-verified — ``docs/claude/antigravity-rpc-spike-notes.md`` §"attended
  TUI"): the RPC flips the backend step to DONE, but the TUI prompt lingers, so a
  web Approve/Reject would not advance the terminal (and the next typed turn would
  fold into the stale prompt's buffer) without this keystroke (#1200). Injectable
  so tests assert the key sequence without a live pane; mirrors cursor-native's
  ``send_cursor_pane_keys`` approval drive.

The deterministic elicitation id is derived from
``(cascade_id, trajectory_id, step_index)`` (mirrors
:func:`omnigent.harnesses.codex_native.elicitation.codex_elicitation_id`), so a
timeout-retry step (new ``step_index``) yields a NEW id → a fresh elicitation is
surfaced for the retry rather than silently reusing the stale card.

"""Post-hoc tool-call policy audit helpers for native Antigravity (agy).

.. note::
    **Currently dormant.** This module's only consumer was the transcript
    forwarder, retired in the Task 12 cutover. The RPC read path that superseded
    it surfaces agy's ``request-review`` prompts as real-time Omnigent
    elicitations (:mod:`omnigent.harnesses.antigravity_native.interactions`) instead of a
    post-hoc audit, so nothing wires these helpers today. They are kept (with
    their unit tests) as the building blocks for a future post-hoc audit pass; the
    references below to "the forwarder" are historical.

**This is POST-HOC, NOT a blocking gate.** agy writes a transcript step only at
``DONE`` (after the tool has executed; there is no token streaming and no
pre-execution signal), and its ``hooks.json`` ``PreToolUse`` hook does **not**
fire on tool execution in agy 1.0.8 (verified — see
``docs/claude/antigravity-native-governance-design.md`` §2.3). So unlike
claude-native's ``PreToolUse`` / codex-native's trusted hook, this harness
**cannot intercept a tool before it runs**. The only honest Omnigent policy
enforcement here is to *observe* each tool call as it appears in the transcript,
evaluate it against the session's policies, and — on a DENY/ASK — surface a
warning conversation item (and, optionally, best-effort interrupt the in-flight
turn; see :func:`maybe_interrupt_turn`). The offending tool has already run by
the time the warning lands.

This module owns the pure, unit-testable pieces of that flow:

* :func:`step_to_audit_tool_calls` — extract neutral ``{tool_name, tool_input}``
  records from one agy transcript step (the ``PLANNER_RESPONSE`` tool-call step).
* :func:`build_audit_evaluation_request` — wrap a tool call as the proto
  ``EvaluationRequest`` the server's ``POST /policies/evaluate`` consumes,
  reusing :func:`omnigent.native.native_policy_hook.hook_payload_to_evaluation_request`
  and stamping ``context.harness = "antigravity-native"`` + ``context.model``.
* :func:`audit_verdict_is_violation` / :func:`audit_violation_warning_text` —
  classify a verdict and render the warning text.
* :func:`build_policy_violation_item` / :func:`build_degrade_notice_item` — the
  two conversation items the forwarder POSTs (the per-violation warning and the
  one-time audit-only degrade notice).

In the forwarder-era flow the async POST + the OFF-by-default interrupt lived in
the (now-deleted) transcript forwarder, which needed the live Omnigent client and
the connect-RPC port and delegated the classification/rendering here.

**Phase used: ``PHASE_TOOL_CALL``.** Tool-name / cost / CEL deny policies fire on
the ``tool_call`` phase (``event.type == "tool_call"``), so the audit must
evaluate at that phase to observe them. The server *can* park a ``tool_call``
``ASK`` server-side (URL elicitation) for a non-read-only caller, which would
block a synchronous POST; the forwarder therefore evaluates with a **bounded
timeout** and treats a timeout as fail-open (logged, no warning) so the
transcript mirror never hangs on a parked ASK. An immediate DENY (and any ASK
returned directly, e.g. a read-only deployment) is surfaced as a warning. This
is best-effort and fail-open by design (R3/R4 in the design doc).

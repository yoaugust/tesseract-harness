"""Turn-completion ("idle") poster state for the hermes-native harness.

The completion->parent-wake path needs a harness to POST an
``external_session_status: idle`` event to the Sessions API: the server maps
that edge to a sub-agent turn-terminal and wakes the parent orchestrator's
inbox (the SAME contract claude-/codex-/opencode-/cursor-native use). Hermes'
PTY-activity watcher only emits a ``session.status: idle`` SSE edge that drives
the web "Working…" spinner and never wakes a parent — so without an explicit
post a hermes-native sub-agent finishes silently and the orchestrator hangs.

Unlike cursor-agent, hermes-agent exposes NO per-turn ``stop`` hook (only a
``pre_tool_call`` hook, used for policy enforcement), so there is no separate
process writing a turn-end marker. Instead the runner-owned
:func:`omnigent.harnesses.hermes_native.forwarder.forward_hermes_store_to_session` poll
loop *derives* turn completion from Hermes' ``state.db`` itself — an
``assistant`` row with no ``tool_calls`` is the agentic loop's terminal step,
i.e. one completed turn (see ``_count_completed_turns`` in that module). The
``messages`` table is the append-only "marker store"; this module owns only the
*poster* state: how many of those completed turns have already been turned into
an ``external_session_status: idle`` post.

It is the hermes analog of the poster-state half of
:mod:`omnigent.harnesses.cursor_native.status`. Persisting the posted-count means a
supervisor restart never re-wakes the parent for a turn it already reported.
Stdlib-only (no httpx) so it stays a cheap, dependency-free state file.

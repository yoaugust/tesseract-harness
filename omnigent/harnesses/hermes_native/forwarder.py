"""TUI→web forwarder for the hermes-native harness.

The ``omnigent hermes`` wrapper launches the real ``hermes`` TUI in a runner-owned
tmux pane, and :mod:`omnigent.harnesses.hermes_native.bridge` injects web-UI messages into
it. That covers the web→TUI direction, but the *embedded terminal* is then the
only surface that reflects the agent's work — the Omnigent conversation view (chat
bubbles, title) stays empty because nothing mirrors the TUI's transcript back into
the session.

This module is that missing mirror — the Hermes analog of
:mod:`omnigent.harnesses.goose_native.forwarder`. Hermes stores all sessions in a single
SQLite database at ``$HERMES_HOME/state.db`` (default ``~/.hermes/state.db``,
verified against the hermes-agent ``hermes_state.py`` schema): a ``sessions`` row
per session (``id`` TEXT, ``source``, ``cwd``, ``started_at`` REAL-seconds) and a
``messages`` row per turn (``id`` autoincrement, ``session_id`` FK, ``role``,
``content`` TEXT, ``active``).

Unlike goose-native, Hermes auto-generates its ``sessions.id`` and gives no
``--name`` to pin it, so discovery follows cursor-native instead: bind the newest
session whose ``cwd`` matches this terminal's workspace and whose ``started_at`` is
at/after the recorded launch time, with a claim guard so two hermes-native sessions
launched in the same cwd never mirror the same row into two conversations. We then
poll ``messages`` past a high-water ``id`` and POST new user/assistant rows as
``external_conversation_item`` events (which also seeds the session title).

To make the web render this harness's in-flight tool calls **live** (a spinner +
ticking elapsed timer, matching claude-/codex-native), the forwarder assigns one
``response_id`` per turn — ``hermes_turn_{opening-msg-id}`` shared across every row
of the turn — POSTs a ``running`` ``external_session_status`` edge carrying that id
at turn start, and stamps the turn's mirrored ``function_call`` items with the same
id (see :func:`_annotate_turn_actions`). The server keys the live card off a
``running`` edge whose ``response_id`` matches the items' ``response_id`` (#1874).

The forwarder deliberately does NOT take ``idle`` ownership: the runner's
PTY-activity watcher (see :mod:`omnigent.runner.app`) still emits the id-less
``running``/``idle`` ``session.status`` edges for hermes-native (as for
goose-/cursor-native), and the server pops the active response id on *any* ``idle``.
A silent tool (e.g. ``sleep``) leaves the pane quiet, so that watcher's ~1s idle
would settle a live card mid-turn — the forwarder therefore re-asserts the in-flight
turn's ``running`` each poll. The trade-off: an aborted turn whose terminal row is
never written is indistinguishable from a silent tool in the store, so its card
stays live until a terminal row lands (an interrupt's empty-prose assistant row
closes the turn) or the next user turn re-opens with a fresh id; the watcher's idle
settles the card only once nothing re-arms the id (turn closed, or this forwarder
died). That watcher drives only the web spinner, though — it never wakes a parent
orchestrator. So this forwarder additionally derives turn completion from the
message log (an ``assistant`` row with no ``tool_calls`` is the agentic loop's
terminal step) and POSTs an ``external_session_status: idle`` event once per
completed turn — the SAME server contract claude-/codex-/opencode-/cursor-native
use to mark a sub-agent turn terminal and wake its parent's inbox. The post is
deduped against a persisted posted-count (:mod:`omnigent.harnesses.hermes_native.status`) so
a supervisor restart never re-wakes the parent for a turn it already reported.

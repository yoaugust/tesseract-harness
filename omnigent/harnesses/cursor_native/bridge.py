"""Filesystem bridge + tmux injection for the cursor-native terminal harness.

The runner launches the ``cursor-agent`` TUI in a private tmux pane and records
that pane's socket + target here via :func:`write_tmux_target`. The harness
executor then delivers Omnigent web-UI messages into the *same* pane via
:func:`inject_user_message` (tmux bracketed paste + Enter) — the cursor analog
of claude-native's tmux send-keys bridge. This is what wires the web-UI chat box
to the running Cursor TUI (and, since the web UI embeds that pane, the message
shows in both surfaces).

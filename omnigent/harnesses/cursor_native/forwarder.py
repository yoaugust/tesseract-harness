"""TUI→web forwarder for the cursor-native harness.

The ``omnigent cursor`` wrapper launches the real ``cursor-agent`` TUI in a
runner-owned tmux pane, and :mod:`omnigent.harnesses.cursor_native.bridge` injects web-UI
messages into it. That covers the web→TUI direction, but the *embedded terminal*
is then the only surface that reflects the agent's work — the Omnigent
conversation view (chat bubbles, title, working spinner) stays empty because
nothing mirrors the TUI's transcript back into the session.

This module is that missing mirror — the cursor analog of
:mod:`omnigent.harnesses.claude_native.forwarder` (which tails Claude Code's JSONL
transcript) and :mod:`omnigent.harnesses.codex_native.forwarder` (which subscribes to the
Codex app-server). cursor-agent has neither a JSONL transcript nor an event
socket; its conversation lives in a **content-addressed SQLite store** at
``~/.cursor/chats/<md5(cwd)>/<chat-id>/store.db``. Each message is a plain-JSON
``blobs`` row (``role`` + ``content``); SQLite ``rowid`` order is conversation
order (the binary Merkle manifest that also lives there is *not* needed). We poll
that store, extract new user/assistant messages, and POST them as
``external_conversation_item`` events — which also seeds the session title from
the first user message (the same hook claude/codex rely on).

The web-facing ``running``/``idle`` *spinner* edges are intentionally NOT posted
here: the runner's PTY-activity watcher owns those ``session.status`` edges for
cursor-native (see ``_publish_turn_status`` in :mod:`omnigent.runner.app`),
exactly as for claude-native and pi-native. That watcher drives only the web
"Working…" spinner, though — it never wakes a parent orchestrator. So this
forwarder additionally POSTs an ``external_session_status: idle`` event once per
completed turn (the cursor ``stop`` hook's turn-end markers, tailed via
:mod:`omnigent.harnesses.cursor_native.status`) — the SAME server contract
claude-/codex-/opencode-native use to mark a sub-agent turn terminal and wake its
parent's inbox.

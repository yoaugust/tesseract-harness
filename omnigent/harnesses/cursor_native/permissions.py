"""Cursor-native tool-approval + question surfacing (TUI → web elicitation).

The ``cursor-agent`` TUI gates its own tool calls (shell, file write/delete, MCP,
…) with an in-terminal approval prompt, and asks structured questions via its
``AskQuestion`` tool. To surface both in the Omnigent web UI (so a user can
answer from the chat view, not just inside the embedded terminal), the runner
tails cursor's chat ``store.db`` — the SAME store the forwarder mirrors — for
*pending tool calls* and drives the TUI to deliver the web verdict:

1. detect a pending tool call (an assistant ``tool-call`` content part carrying
   ``providerOptions.cursor.pendingToolCallStartedAtMs`` with no matching
   ``tool-result`` yet — see :func:`read_cursor_pending_tool_calls`),
2. after a short settle (auto-approved calls resolve inside it and never
   surface), POST it to the server's ``cursor-permission-request`` hook, which
   publishes ``response.elicitation_request`` and parks for the web verdict,
3. on the verdict, drive the cursor TUI by sending keystrokes into the pane
   (``y``/``Escape`` for an approval; the picker navigation for a question),
4. if the pending call instead disappears on its own (the user answered in the
   embedded terminal), POST ``external_elicitation_resolved`` to clear the card.

Detection lives in the transcript (keyed on the stable ``toolCallId``), NOT in
pane scraping — which silently missed any prompt whose wording fell outside a
regex. The pane is still used only to *deliver* the keystroke verdict. This does
NOT modify cursor's JS bundle and does NOT suppress cursor's native gate; the
TUI prompt remains the source of truth and the benign fallback if store
detection ever fails. Sessions launched with ``--yolo`` / ``--force`` / ``-f``
auto-accept lingering tool gates in-pane (no web card) because cursor's Run
Everything mode still sometimes leaves a pending marker long enough to stall a
piloted parent. That accept is deliberately fail-closed: it only fires while
the pane is live and actually showing cursor's accept hint, it is capped at a
few attempts, and anything it does not clear falls back to the ordinary web
card rather than typing ``y`` into the composer forever. See
``docs/cursor-native-elicitation.md`` (and the
superseded ``docs/cursor-native-tui-mirror-plan.md`` for the original pane-scrape
design and why the transcript channel replaced it).

# Transcript-based elicitation detection (preferred over pane scraping)
#
# Pane scraping (above) recognises a prompt by its rendered wording, so it
# silently misses any prompt whose verb/keys fall outside the regex (e.g. the
# file-deletion prompt "Delete this file? → Delete (y) / Keep (n)", whose accept
# verb "Delete" is not in the run/allow/approve allowlist). The cursor chat
# ``store.db`` — the same store the forwarder tails — records the gated tool call
# itself the moment cursor blocks on it, which is a far more reliable signal:
#
#   • A blocked tool call is written as an assistant ``tool-call`` content part
#     carrying ``providerOptions.cursor.pendingToolCallStartedAtMs`` (an
#     auto-run call has the part but NOT the marker). The pending call lives
#     only inside cursor's binary protobuf *checkpoint* frame (not yet flushed
#     as a plain-JSON ``blobs`` row), so we scan each blob's raw bytes for
#     embedded JSON objects rather than ``json.loads``-ing the whole row.
#   • When the call is answered (in the web UI or the TUI), cursor appends a
#     ``tool-result`` content part with the SAME ``toolCallId``. So an active
#     elicitation is exactly a pending ``tool-call`` whose ``toolCallId`` has no
#     matching ``tool-result`` yet.
#
# This captures EVERY gated tool (Delete, Write, shell, …) with structured
# ``toolName`` + ``args``, with the ``toolCallId`` as a stable correlation key —
# no prompt-wording allowlist. The pane is still used to DELIVER the verdict
# (send-keys ``y`` / ``Escape``); only DETECTION moves to the transcript.
#
# Verified against cursor-agent 2026.06.24; the store schema is private and
# version-sensitive, so this remains a best-effort channel — cursor's own TUI
# gate stays authoritative, exactly as the pane mirror's contract.

    The transcript counterpart of :func:`supervise_cursor_approval_mirror`:
    instead of scraping the rendered pane, it tails this session's cursor
    ``store.db`` for pending tool calls (see
    :func:`read_cursor_pending_tool_calls`). A call is surfaced only once it has
    stayed continuously pending for ``settle_s`` — auto-approved calls resolve
    inside cursor's gate-decision window and so never produce a (flashing) card,
    while a call that truly waits on a human persists well past it. A surfaced
    call is parked on the server hook exactly as the pane mirror does; on the web
    verdict it sends the ``y`` / ``Escape`` keystroke into the pane, and when a
    surfaced call later vanishes from the store while still parked (answered in
    the TUI, or executed after approval) it releases the card via
    ``external_elicitation_resolved``.

    When ``auto_accept_approvals`` is set (sessions launched with ``--yolo`` /
    ``--force`` / ``-f``), tool-approval gates are accepted in-pane without a
    web card. Cursor's Run Everything mode still sometimes leaves a pending
    marker long enough to otherwise stall a piloted parent on mirrored
    ApprovalCards. ``AskQuestion`` still surfaces — that is intentional human
    input, not a tool gate. The accept is bounded and fail-closed (see
    :func:`_yolo_auto_accept`): a gate it does not clear falls back to the same
    card the non-yolo path would have shown.

    Store discovery reuses the forwarder's logic, so this binds to the same chat
    the forwarder mirrors. Detection is keyed by ``toolCallId`` (stable across
    polls and restarts), capturing every gated tool kind without a
    prompt-wording allowlist.

"""Turn-completion ("idle") signal for the cursor-native harness.

cursor-agent fires its ``stop`` hook once per completed turn (see
:func:`omnigent.harnesses.cursor_native.bridge.build_hooks_config`, which registers the
:mod:`omnigent.harnesses.cursor_native.usage` recorder). That hook is the ONLY
authoritative "this turn just finished" signal cursor-agent exposes: its SQLite
chat store (tailed by :mod:`omnigent.harnesses.cursor_native.forwarder`) carries no
turn-boundary marker, and the runner's PTY-activity watcher only drives the web
"Working…" spinner (a ``session.status`` edge) — which never wakes a parent
orchestrator.

So the stop hook ALSO appends a turn-end marker line here (alongside its usage
line), and the runner-owned
:func:`omnigent.harnesses.cursor_native.forwarder.forward_cursor_store_to_session` poll
loop tails it and POSTs an ``external_session_status: idle`` event — the SAME
server contract claude-/codex-/opencode-native use to mark a sub-agent turn
terminal and wake its parent's inbox. Without this a cursor-native sub-agent
finished silently and never notified the orchestrator.

Stdlib-only (no httpx) so importing it from the stop hook keeps the hook fast —
cursor blocks the turn end on the hook.

"""Codex Code hook entrypoint for native Omnigent policy enforcement.

Registered as the ``PreToolUse`` / ``PostToolUse`` command hook in the
per-session private ``CODEX_HOME`` (see

a short subprocess before/after each built-in tool call, piping the hook
payload on stdin and reading a verdict on stdout. The conversion to/from

    Evaluate a Codex ``PreToolUse`` / ``PostToolUse`` /
    ``UserPromptSubmit`` hook against Omnigent policies.

    Reads the hook JSON payload from stdin, converts it into the
    proto-compatible ``EvaluationRequest`` schema via
    :func:`omnigent.native.native_policy_hook.hook_payload_to_evaluation_request`,
    POSTs to ``/v1/sessions/{id}/policies/evaluate``, and converts the
    ``EvaluationResponse`` back into Codex's hook output format
    (``hookSpecificOutput.permissionDecision`` for PreToolUse;
    ``additionalContext`` warning for PostToolUse; top-level
    ``decision: "block"`` for UserPromptSubmit — the request-phase gate
    for native sessions, which drops the prompt before the model runs).

    Failure handling is phase-aware (mirroring the runner-side default
    from PR #163), shared with the Claude-native hook. Once the session is
    known to be governed (an active session id and a configured
    ``ap_server_url``) and the round-trip to ``/policies/evaluate`` cannot
    yield a usable verdict — server unreachable, non-2xx, or an empty /
    malformed body — a ``PreToolUse`` (``PHASE_TOOL_CALL``) call fails
    CLOSED with a ``deny`` (this hook is the sole enforcement point for
    native tools), while ``UserPromptSubmit`` and ``PostToolUse`` fail
    OPEN. Conditions that mean the session simply is not governed — no
    bridge state, no ``ap_server_url``, an unparseable payload, or an
    ``mcp__omnigent__*`` tool already gated on the relay path — still
    return exit 0 with no output ("no opinion") so non-Omnigent tool calls
    are never blocked. The complementary fail-loud guard — asserting the
    hook is actually registered and trusted — lives at session startup in

    prompt submit, in order:

    1. Fast skip on ``<bridge_dir>/turn_routing_done`` **when it names this
       session** — no output, no network. The authoritative gate is the
       endpoint's routing-decision check; this file only saves the round

       is not ours to skip on.
    2. POST ``{session_id, prompt, harness, turn_id, model}`` to the
       advertised loopback ``route-turn`` endpoint. ``model`` comes from
       the hook payload, which tracks the LIVE thread model —
       ``config.toml`` reports the stale launch model.
    3. On a routed verdict: check the pick against this pane's live
       ``model/list``, switch the thread with ``thread/settings/update``
       (codex binds the turn's model before this hook runs, so the switch
       lands from the next turn), write the marker, and BLOCK the prompt.
       The runner then replays it as a normal user turn, which runs on the
       routed model.

    Fails open everywhere: an absent advertisement, an unreachable
    endpoint, an unroutable verdict, a pick this pane's gateway does not
    serve, or a failed switch all exit ``0`` with no output, and the prompt
    runs untouched on the current model.

"""Qwen-native tool-approval mirror (TUI → web elicitation).

The ``qwen`` TUI gates its own tool calls (shell, file write, …) with an
in-terminal approval prompt. Unlike cursor-native — where the prompt lives only
in the TUI's in-memory state and has to be scraped off the pane — qwen exposes a
structured **permission control plane** on its dual-output stream: whenever a
tool needs approval it emits a ``control_request`` / ``can_use_tool`` event on
``--json-file`` (coexisting with the in-terminal prompt) and accepts a
``confirmation_response`` on ``--input-file`` (whichever side answers first
wins, the loser is harmlessly dropped). See qwen's ``dual-output.md``.

So to surface those approvals in the Omnigent web UI (so a user on the Chat tab
can answer from the chat view, not just inside the embedded terminal), the runner
tails the same event stream the transcript forwarder uses:

1. read a ``control_request`` / ``can_use_tool`` off ``--json-file`` (structured,
   no pane scraping),
2. POST it to the server's generic ``native-permission-request`` hook (shared
   with the hermes-/goose-native mirrors; ``agent="qwen"`` labels the card),
   which publishes the standard ``response.elicitation_request`` event and parks
   for the web verdict (the same machinery cursor-/codex-native use),
3. on the verdict, answer qwen by appending a ``confirmation_response`` to
   ``--input-file`` (``allowed=True`` on accept, ``False`` on decline/cancel) —
   no keystrokes,
4. if instead a ``control_response`` for that ``request_id`` appears while the
   card is still parked (the user answered inside the embedded terminal, or qwen
   auto-resolved), POST ``external_elicitation_resolved`` so the parked web card
   clears and skip the now-stale ``confirmation_response``.

This deliberately does NOT suppress qwen's native gate; qwen's own prompt remains
the source of truth and the fallback if the mirror ever misses a request (the
user can still answer in the terminal). It is the cleaner, structured analog of
:mod:`omnigent.harnesses.cursor_native.permissions`. See ``docs/QWEN_NATIVE_DESIGN.md`` and
``docs/QWEN_FOLLOWUPS.md``.

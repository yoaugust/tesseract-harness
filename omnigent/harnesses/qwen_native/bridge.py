"""File + tmux bridge for the qwen-native terminal harness.

Unlike goose-/cursor-native (which simulate keystrokes via ``tmux send-keys``),
``qwen`` ships a built-in remote-control protocol that we drive through two files
the TUI is launched against:

- ``--input-file`` (:func:`input_file_path`): ``qwen`` ``watchFile``\\s it and
  parses appended JSONL commands. We append ``{"type":"submit","text":...}`` to
  deliver a web-UI turn (qwen routes it through the *same* ``submitQuery`` path
  the keyboard uses, so it renders in the TUI transcript) and
  ``{"type":"confirmation_response","request_id":...,"allowed":...}`` to answer a
  tool-approval request.
- ``--json-file`` (:func:`events_file_path`): ``qwen`` streams structured JSON
  events here while the TUI renders normally; :mod:`omnigent.harnesses.qwen_native.forwarder`
  tails it.

The runner launches the TUI in a runner-owned tmux pane (for the embedded
display) and records that pane via :func:`write_tmux_target`. Message injection
is file-based, but two affordances still go through the pane because qwen's
input-file watcher has no command for them: **interrupt** (Stop → ``Escape``, see
:func:`inject_interrupt`) and **hard stop** (:func:`kill_session`).

Verified against ``qwen`` v0.18.1 (``RemoteInputWatcher`` + dual-output). See
``docs/QWEN_NATIVE_DESIGN.md``.

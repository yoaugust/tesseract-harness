"""Bridge utilities for the native Claude Code wrapper.

The native wrapper has two live processes that need to rendezvous:

- Claude Code, running in the user's terminal resource.
- The Omnigent harness turn, running when the web UI submits a
  message to the session agent.

This module owns the small filesystem rendezvous directory plus two
helper surfaces:

- An MCP stdio server (``serve-mcp`` subcommand) that Claude Code
  launches as a child process. It advertises Omnigent tools to
  Claude (workspace ``sys_os_*`` tools outside an active turn,
  active-turn Omnigent tools via a per-turn relay).
- A tmux send-keys path. Web UI messages are delivered to Claude by
  typing them into the same tmux pane the user is attached to;
  Claude treats them as ordinary user input. The runner advertises
  the pane's socket + target in ``tmux.json`` after launching the
  ``claude/main`` terminal.

Claude's experimental Channels MCP capability was the original input
path but is blocked at the org policy layer, so this bridge does not
use it.

    Pre-accept Claude Code's first-run trust + onboarding prompts.

    Claude Code blocks on two TUI prompts the first time it launches in
    a new context: a global onboarding flow (theme / login) gated by the
    top-level ``hasCompletedOnboarding`` key in ``~/.claude.json``, and a
    per-directory "Do you trust the files in this folder?" dialog gated
    by ``projects["<abs cwd>"].hasTrustDialogAccepted``. Neither fires a
    ``PermissionRequest`` hook, so on a host-spawned (web-UI-driven)
    session there is nobody at the terminal to answer them: Claude hangs
    and the web UI shows nothing. This is acute with
    per-session git worktrees, which hand Claude a brand-new —
    therefore untrusted — directory on every session.

    Seed both gating keys idempotently so the launch never blocks. Only
    those two keys are written; all other ``~/.claude.json`` state (the
    user's own onboarding choices, project history, MCP config, OAuth
    account) is preserved, and the file is left untouched when both keys
    are already set. This deliberately does NOT skip per-tool permission
    prompts — those still route to the web UI via the ``PermissionRequest``
    hook; only the unhookable startup gates are pre-accepted.

    Concurrency: this is a read-modify-write of a file Claude itself also
    rewrites. It runs once, before the terminal is launched (so Claude is
    not yet writing for this session), and uses an atomic replace. Two
    runners starting on the same host within the same instant could still

    Cost is linear in token counts, so summing per-message costs equals
    pricing the token totals — but per-message pricing also stays correct
    across a model switch within one transcript.

    **Deduplicated by ``requestId``.** Claude writes more than one
    transcript record for a single API response (a streamed partial plus
    the final record, retries, etc.), and those records share one
    ``requestId`` while each carries that response's full ``message.usage``
    (not an increment). Summing every record would bill the same response
    two-plus times — observed ~2x inflation, with the parent badge and the
    cost-budget gate both reading the doubled figure. So records are keyed
    by ``requestId`` (last priceable record per id wins, as its usage is
    the authoritative final figure) and each billed response is counted
    exactly once. A record with no ``requestId`` (rare non-API assistant
    entry) gets a per-record unique key so it is never collapsed with
    another.

    :param transcript_path: Path to a Claude transcript JSONL, e.g.
        ``".../<session>.jsonl"`` (parent) or
        ``".../subagents/agent-<id>.jsonl"`` (sub-agent).
    :param include_sidechains: ``False`` for a parent transcript — its
        sub-agent records are inlined as ``isSidechain: true`` and are
        skipped here (they are counted via the sub-agent's own
        transcript) to avoid double-billing. ``True`` for a sub-agent's
        own ``agent-<id>.jsonl``, where every record is a sidechain.
    :returns: Total USD cost across priced assistant messages, or
        ``None`` when the transcript has no assistant message that could
        be priced (missing/empty file, no usage, or pricing unavailable
        for every model present) — distinct from ``0.0``, which means
        priced messages summed to zero.

    Deliver a user message into the Claude terminal via tmux send-keys.

    Before typing, this waits for two readiness conditions: the runner
    advertising ``tmux.json``, then Claude Code's input box rendering
    (see :func:`_wait_for_claude_prompt_ready`). The second gate closes
    a race on freshly-created sessions where the first message would
    otherwise be typed into a still-booting TUI and silently dropped.
    Between the two, anything the person left occupying the composer
    from the embedded terminal — a ctrl+r history search, a rewind
    dialog, a ``/config`` panel, ``!`` shell mode — is dismissed with
    Escape (see :func:`_restore_occupied_input`), so the message reclaims
    the input box instead of being typed into that surface.

    Delivered as one bracketed paste via ``tmux load-buffer`` (from a
    temp file) + ``paste-buffer -p`` so interior newlines ride as raw CR
    inside the paste markers and Claude Code's TUI keeps multi-line
    input as data rather than submitting on each newline
    (anthropics/claude-code#52126). A trailing newline inside the paste
    absorbs any trailing backslash — otherwise ``\`` + the submit
    ``Enter`` reads as a line-continuation and the message sits unsent.
    ``Enter`` is a separate tmux call. The file-based buffer
    path (not ``send-keys`` argv) matters: tmux caps a single
    client→server command at ~16KB, so a large message — e.g. a PR diff
    in a sub-agent dispatch — failed with "command too long".

    The submit is **verified, not fire-and-forget**: Claude Code
    coalesces rapid stdin bursts into a paste, so an Enter that lands
    while the TUI is still consuming the paste is folded in as a
    newline and the draft sits unsent. This helper first polls
    ``capture-pane`` until the draft is visible in the input box (the
    paste was committed), sends Enter, then polls that the draft left
    the box — re-sending Enter while it hasn't — and raises if the
    message never submits.

    A message leading with an *unknown* slash command passes through
    unescaped on the guess that it names a skill. When Claude Code
    rejects that guess ("Unknown command: /<name>") it drops the whole
    message without calling the model, so after such a submit the pane
    is watched briefly for the rejection and the message is re-delivered
    escaped (zero-width prefix) as plain user text — the message is never
    silently swallowed. A recognized skill prints no rejection and runs
    exactly as before.

    (``Popen``, not awaited) — the caller returns immediately while the
    modal lives on the attached client until the user answers.

    Claude-native resolver for the harness-agnostic
    :func:`omnigent.native.native_cost_popup.launch_cost_popup`: it reads the
    pane's tmux socket/target from this bridge's ``tmux.json`` and points
    the popup at *config_file* for Omnigent routing (base URL + auth
    headers, so no token lands on the command line), then delegates. The
    launcher pops the modal on every attached client and skips silently when
    none is attached (e.g. the Terminal tab is closed) — the web
    ``ApprovalCard`` remains the answer surface.

    :param bridge_dir: Bridge directory path, e.g.
        ``/tmp/omnigent/claude-native/<digest>``. Supplies the tmux target
        (``tmux.json``); the AP-routing config comes from *config_file*.
    :param session_id: Omnigent session id that owns the elicitation, e.g.
        ``"conv_abc123"``. Used in the resolve URL the popup POSTs to.

        ``"elicit_deadbeef"``.

    :param policy_name: Name of the deciding policy, rendered as the
        modal header. ``None`` falls back to a generic header.
    :param python_executable: Python used to run the popup module;
        ``None`` uses :data:`sys.executable` (the runner's interpreter,
        valid on the host the tmux server runs on).
    :param timeout_s: Seconds to wait for ``tmux.json`` to be advertised,
        e.g. ``30.0``.
    :param config_file: AP-routing config the popup reads (base URL + auth
        headers). ``None`` falls back to this bridge's ``permission_hook.json``
        — but that carries the one-shot launch token, which dies with the ~1h
        Databricks OAuth lifetime, so callers should pass a freshly-minted
        snapshot to keep a late-firing verdict POST from 401-ing.
    :returns: None.

    the web-UI message wins the pane.

    A rule may also carry a **label**: Claude Code breaks the box's
    opening rule with the session's title (``"──── my session ─"``). The

    every glyph be a rule glyph instead anchors :func:`_composer_row` on

    ordinary output from passing as a rule: a pasted ``tree``/table line of

    When Claude Code's input prompt never renders, its own on-screen
    output — often a startup error or stack trace (e.g. a ``JSON Parse
    error`` raised when its API client receives an HTML page instead of
    JSON) — is the only signal of the real cause. The readiness gate
    raises into the web UI's error banner, so attaching this tail
    surfaces that cause without the user having to open the terminal.

    :param pane: Captured pane text from :func:`_capture_pane`.
    :returns: A ``" Last terminal output:\n<tail>"`` block — the last
        :data:`_TERMINAL_FAILURE_TAIL_LINES` non-blank lines, capped at
        :data:`_TERMINAL_FAILURE_TAIL_CHARS` characters — or ``""`` when
        the pane has no visible text.

    Block until Claude Code's TUI input box is ready for keystrokes.

    The runner advertises ``tmux.json`` as soon as the tmux session
    exists, but Claude Code's input box mounts a few seconds later
    (longer on a cold first boot). Keystrokes sent into that gap are
    dropped, so the first web-UI message silently vanishes. This gate
    polls ``capture-pane`` for the input prompt before injection;
    it returns immediately once mounted, so 2nd+ messages are
    unaffected.

    which exclusively serves the Claude Code terminal. It must never be

    itself when delivering the buffer to the pane.

    Content bytes are mapped so Claude Code's TUI keeps the paste as
    editable data rather than submitting on each line:

    - ``\n`` and ``\r`` (and a ``\r\n`` pair coalesced) become a single
      carriage return ``0x0d`` — the byte a real paste carries between
      lines inside the markers.
    - ``\t`` becomes ``0x09``.
    - Any other control byte below ``0x20`` is dropped: a stray ``ESC``
      (or BEL, etc.) in the content would otherwise prematurely close
      the bracketed-paste sequence on the agent's side.
    - All other characters pass through as their UTF-8 bytes.

# Claude Code points its auth failures at ``/login`` — a dead end in the
# web chat, where ``/login`` is a dropped command: it is escaped into
# plain text and answered by the same expired session with the same
# line. These records get guidance APPENDED sending the user to
# ``omni setup`` on the host, which does re-authenticate.
#
# The strings are hardcoded constants in the CLI binary (read out of
# @anthropic-ai/claude-code 2.1.212), and there is more than one shape:
#
#     "Login expired · Please run /login"
#     "OAuth token revoked · Please run /login"
#     "...organization has disabled API key authentication · Run /login
#      to sign in with your claude.ai account"
#
# so the instruction is not always the trailing clause and is not always
# spelled "Please run". Rather than edit inside a sentence whose shape
# the next CLI release may change, the guidance is appended below the
# CLI's own text. Appending, not replacing: some variants carry a
# remedy beyond re-auth ("If CLAUDE_CODE_OAUTH_TOKEN is set, unset it
# or re-mint it ... then /logout and /login.", "Credit balance too low
# · Run /login to switch accounts") and wholesale replacement would
# delete the only instruction that fixes them, stranding the user with
# advice for a different problem.
#
# Matching the bare token anywhere in the message is only safe because
# it is paired with :func:`_is_api_error_entry`: a flagged record is not
# model output, so there is no prose to mislabel. An UNFLAGGED record is
# never touched, however much it looks like the error — appending
# remedy text to a real model turn that merely mentions /login would
# misdirect the user, which is worse than leaving the CLI's line alone.
#
# The lookbehind keeps paths and URLs out (``a/login``, ``//login``,
# ``https://host/login``); ``\b`` keeps ``/loginfoo`` out while still
# matching ``/login.`` and ``/login,``. A token-initial ``/login/...``
# still matches — acceptable, because only flagged CLI-authored
# constants ever reach this check.
#
# ``/logout`` is deliberately NOT matched. The CLI has auth errors that
# name it alone — "· unset it or /logout to clear the saved key",
# "Unset the ANTHROPIC_API_KEY environment variable, or claude /logout
# then say ...", "This background session shares credentials with other
# sessions; /logout here has no effect." Those describe a DIFFERENT
# failure (an env var or another session overriding the credential)
# whose remedy is unsetting that variable — something ``omni setup``
# does not do, so pointing at it there would only add noise. The one
# shape worth catching, "...then /logout and /login.", already matches
# on its ``/login``.

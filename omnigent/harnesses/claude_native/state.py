"""Persistent client-side state for ``omnigent claude`` sessions.

The wrapper records a small amount of per-conversation state at session
creation time and reads it back on resume. Today the only recorded fact
is the **launch cwd**: Claude Code's ``--resume <claude_sid>`` requires
the resuming invocation's cwd to match the cwd of the original session,
and resuming from a different directory makes Claude exit immediately.
The picker and the resume-helper both read the recorded cwd to detect a
mismatch and offer to ``chdir`` before spawning Claude.

Why client-side and not server-side: the launch cwd is a fact about
*this client invocation on this user's machine*. It has no meaning to
other clients or to the server. Putting it on the server would:

* leak filesystem layout across users in shared deployments (a path
  like ``/home/alice/private/project`` would be visible to anyone who
  could see the conversation),
* embed client-process state in a server-side entity (poor layering),
* require a database migration for a fact the client owns.

Why under ``~/.omnigent/`` and not the existing bridge dir at
``/tmp/omnigent-<uid>/claude-native/``: tmpfs gets cleared on
reboot (and by tmp-cleaner cron on many distros). The bridge dir is
correctly transient for hooks / tmux / token state, but the launch
cwd needs to survive across reboots so a user who resumes a session
the day after creating it still gets the chdir prompt. ``~/.omnigent/``
is where the persistent Omnigent server SQLite db and other durable
single-user state already live.

Layout (per conversation):

    ~/.omnigent/claude-native/<sha256(conv_id)[:32]>/launch.json

The directory is hashed (not the raw conv id) so a malicious server
returning an attacker-chosen conversation id like ``"../../../etc"``
cannot escape ``~/.omnigent/claude-native/``. A short hash is enough
because we never enumerate the directory by id; we only look up the
deterministic path for a known conv id.

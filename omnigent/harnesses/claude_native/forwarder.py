# - ``Stop`` → idle: the sub-agent terminal-delivery edge (→ parent inbox +

#   exactly once per finished turn, where the PTY-activity ``idle`` was a

#   premature completion that idempotently locked out the real one. It also
#   carries the background-shell count. It agrees with the file rather than
#   competing with it, so arrival order does not matter — the shared edge
#   dedup collapses the pair.
# - ``StopFailure`` → failed: the file has no failure literal (it returns to
#   ``idle`` on a turn error exactly as on success), so this is the only
#   source of the red pill, ``last_task_error``, and a failed scheduled run.

    POST the parent session's cost as TWO values: display and policy.

    The parent session's cost-budget policy gates EVERY tool call in the
    Claude process — including a Task sub-agent's, whose ``PreToolUse``
    hook the runner evaluates against this parent session (the bridge has
    one active session id; there is no per-sub-agent policy routing). But
    Claude Code's statusLine ``total_cost_usd`` (``S``) is **frozen for
    the entire duration of a sub-agent run** — the statusLine isn't even
    invoked while a sub-agent runs; ``S`` jumps to the sub-agent-inclusive
    total only when the sub-agent returns (verified live). So a value
    based on ``S`` alone can't gate a runaway sub-agent mid-turn.

    Display and enforcement therefore need different numbers, posted as
    two separate fields the server persists independently:

    - ``cumulative_cost_usd`` = ``S`` verbatim — the DISPLAY cost. The
      parent badge then matches ``/cost`` in the Claude TUI exactly (``S``
      is Claude's own billing and already includes sub-agent spend once
      settled). It is frozen during a sub-agent run; that's acceptable
      for display.
    - ``policy_cost_usd`` = ``max(S, C)`` — the POLICY/budget cost. ``C``
      is the forwarder's real-time estimate (parent transcript own
      messages + each tracked sub-agent's transcript, each priced once
      per ``requestId``). ``C`` advances while ``S`` is frozen, so the
      gate sees in-flight sub-agent spend and can block mid-turn. With no
      sub-agent there is no lag, so it equals ``S``.

    The brief intra-turn divergence (badge shows frozen ``S`` while the
    gate uses the higher live ``C``) is intentional and reconciles at the
    turn boundary when ``S`` jumps; ``max`` keeps both monotonic.

    Best-effort, like the other forwarder posts: a failed POST is retried
    on the next poll (the ``dedupe`` baselines advance only on success).

    :param client: Omnigent HTTP client.
    :param session_id: Parent (claude-native) conversation id the cost is
        attributed to, e.g. ``"conv_abc123"``.
    :param bridge_dir: Native Claude bridge directory (holds the
        statusLine snapshot read for ``S``).
    :param parent_transcript_path: Parent transcript JSONL path — used for
        the ``C`` estimate and to locate the ``subagents/`` directory.
    :param subagent_state: Current sub-agent cursor map; its tracked

    Forward currently available hook events as ``session.status``.

    Maps ``Stop`` → ``idle`` and ``StopFailure`` → ``failed`` via
    ``POST /v1/sessions/{id}/events`` with type ``external_session_status``
    — the authoritative turn-end edges that drive sub-agent terminal
    delivery (see :data:`_HOOK_EVENT_TO_STATUS`). ``running`` stays
    PTY-derived (the pane-activity watcher drives the UI badge). Other hook
    event names advance the cursor without emitting (no status meaning).

    Also forwards native task state changes (``TaskCreated``,
    ``TaskCompleted``, ``PostToolUse``/``TaskUpdate``) and
    ``PostToolUse``/``TodoWrite`` todo updates as
    ``external_session_todos`` events. The ``task_subjects``,
    ``task_statuses``, and ``task_order`` dicts are mutated in-place
    to accumulate per-session task state across polls.

    :param client: Omnigent HTTP client.
    :param session_id: Omnigent session/conversation id.
    :param bridge_dir: Native Claude bridge directory.
    :param state: Current hook cursor state.
    :param retry_tracker: In-memory retry/backoff tracker for hook
        status posts.
    :param dedupe: Mutable per-session baseline; turn-end edges record
        the ended turn's id on it as a pending settle (scheduled-wake
        detection — see :func:`_promote_pending_settle`).
    :param task_subjects: Mutable map of task_id → subject text for the
        native task system, e.g. ``{"1": "Create folder 'abc'"}``.
        Updated in-place from ``TaskCreated`` hook events.
    :param task_statuses: Mutable map of task_id → status string for the
        native task system, e.g. ``{"1": "in_progress", "2": "pending"}``.
        Updated in-place from ``TaskCreated``, ``TaskCompleted``, and
        ``PostToolUse``/``TaskUpdate`` hook events.
    :param task_order: Mutable ordered list of task ids in creation order,
        e.g. ``["1", "2", "3"]``. Appended in-place from ``TaskCreated``
        events. Used to render the task list in a stable order.
    :param response_id: Active turn's response id, stamped on the
        ``Stop``→``idle`` / ``StopFailure``→``failed`` edges so ap-web
        closes the streaming ``activeResponse`` opened by the matching
        turn-start ``running`` edge. ``None`` when no turn id is known
        (the status still posts, just without a turn association).
    :returns: Updated state. On post failure, returns the last
        durable state so successfully-posted statuses are not
        retried and the failing event is retried later.

    Resolve a completion hook that found no pending ``PreCompact`` token.

    Restores the legacy standalone-completion safety. A
    ``SessionStart source=compact`` (compaction *completed*) can arrive with
    no live token for two reasons, which must be handled differently:

    * The transcript ``isCompactSummary`` path already persisted this
      compaction's boundary and set ``expect_completion_ack`` for its ``seq``
      — this hook is the trailing duplicate completion signal. Absorb it
      (clear the window, return ``None``): re-persisting would write a second
      boundary.
    * No boundary is expected — the ``PreCompact`` was dropped or the
      forwarder attached after it fired, so neither the transcript path nor a
      token exists to persist the boundary. Mint a fresh monotonic ``seq``,
      install it as the pending token (so a later transcript summary
      reconciles against the same sequence), and return it for the caller to
      persist. On POST failure the caller leaves the token set for retry.

    The ack window is bound to the ``seq`` it was armed for
    (``expect_completion_ack_seq``). A hook is absorbed *only* when that seq
    is genuinely present in ``persisted_seqs`` — the boundary the ack would
    acknowledge really was stored. This closes the compound-miss lost-boundary
    hazard (P2-1): if compaction A persists via the transcript path, A's
    completion hook never fires (so the flag stays armed), and a later
    compaction B's ``PreCompact`` is *also* dropped, B's completion hook would
    otherwise be swallowed as A's stale ack and B's boundary lost. Requiring
    the armed seq to be persisted does not by itself distinguish A's late hook
    from B's hook (both correlate to the same session and A's seq is
    persisted), so absorption stays one-shot: the window is closed the first
    time it is consumed, and any *further* completion hook with no armed ack
    falls through to a standalone persist. The residual — A's real trailing
    hook arriving *after* B's boundary already reused the one-shot window — is
    an at-most-once duplicate boundary (deduped downstream / benign on
    resume), which we accept over a lost boundary. If the flag is armed but
    its seq is not persisted (corrupt/partial state, or a legacy file with no
    recorded seq), we bias to safe and persist rather than absorb.

    :param bridge_dir: Native Claude bridge directory.
    :returns: The ``seq`` to persist for a genuine standalone boundary, or

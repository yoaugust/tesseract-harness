        Run an async invocation — either by spawning a child workflow
        or by producing the result inline.

        Called by the runtime (from an async workflow body) when
        :meth:`is_async` returned True. Two return shapes are
        supported, and the runtime's ``_execute_tools`` dispatcher
        accepts both:

        - **Background dispatch (the common case).** The tool creates
          a child ``task_store`` row, starts the runner-side async task pinned to
          that task_id, and returns an ``_AsyncToolHandle`` (defined
          in ``omnigent.runtime.workflow``). The handle is
          serialized via ``to_handle_json`` and surfaced to the LLM
          as the tool-call output; the real result arrives later
          through the async-work drain.
        - **Inline async work.** The tool returns a ``str`` directly.
          The runtime treats it as a normal sync tool result without
          spawning any child. Used by tools whose work needs the
          parent's async loop (e.g., draining a runner inbox via
          ``the async-work drain``) but produces a result immediately —
          ``sys_read_inbox`` is the canonical example. Also used by
          tools like ``sys_call_async`` to surface argument-validation
          errors that don't justify a child workflow.

        The default raises ``NotImplementedError`` — subclasses that
        override :meth:`is_async` to return True MUST override this
        as well. The split lets synchronous tools ignore the async
        path entirely without import-cycle headaches around
        ``_AsyncToolHandle``.

        :param parent_task_id: The currently-executing parent
            workflow's task_id. The new child task points at it via
            ``root_task_id``; the background workflow signals it via
            the ``async_work_complete`` topic. Inline-result tools
            may ignore this.
        :param parent_conversation_id: The owning conversation's id.
            Recorded on the child task row for conversation-scoped
            queries. Inline-result tools may ignore this.
        :param agent_id: The owning agent's id. Recorded on the
            child task row. Inline-result tools may ignore this.
        :param agent_name: The tool's name (same as ``self.name()``
            in most cases) — recorded as ``agent_name`` on the task
            so ``list_tasks`` results show what produced the work.
            Inline-result tools may ignore this.
        :param arguments: JSON-encoded argument string from the LLM.
        :param workspace_path: Per-conversation workspace directory
            (or ``None`` if this tool doesn't need it).
        :returns: Either an ``_AsyncToolHandle`` instance (the
            runtime's shared handle shape, for the background path)
            or a ``str`` (for inline-result tools). Typed as ``Any``
            to avoid importing the runtime module from the tool
            base.

"""MCP server connections with tool discovery and caching.

``McpServerConnection`` wraps a single MCP server (stdio or HTTP)
and exposes ``connect()`` / ``call_tool()`` / ``close()``. Each
connection runs a long-lived lifecycle task that owns the
transport + ``ClientSession`` for the connection's full lifespan
so resource teardown happens on the same task that opened them
(anyio cancel-scope identity).

The runner's :class:`omnigent.runner.mcp_manager.RunnerMcpManager`
is the only production consumer; see designs/RUNNER_MCP.md.

    Detect a request timeout caused by a dead transport.

    A transient network failure mid-call (connection reset, brief
    refusal window) kills the transport's lifecycle task; the
    in-flight request then never receives a response and surfaces
    as the SDK's request-timeout ``McpError`` instead of the
    underlying network error. Distinguish that from a live-but-slow
    server by two explicit signals, either of which classifies the
    timeout as a connection failure worth a reconnect-retry:

    - The lifecycle task died and cleared ``_session`` (e.g. the
      transport task group crashed on a pre-response failure).
    - A network-level failure was recorded at the httpx layer
      (``_transport_error``). This is the common production shape:
      with the locked MCP SDK, a reset that lands *after* the
      request was sent is swallowed inside the streamable-HTTP
      client (the SSE response path logs and returns without a
      resumable event id; the JSON path forwards the exception to a
      message handler that drops it by default), so the lifecycle
      task stays alive and ``_session`` stays live while the
      pending request can never complete.

    A timeout with a live session and a clean transport is a
    genuine tool timeout and must not be retried — MCP tools are
    not guaranteed idempotent.

    Two caveats, both deliberate:

    - Retrying the recorded-error branch is at-least-once delivery:
      the response was lost after the server may have fully executed
      the tool, so the retry can re-execute it. This matches the
      existing ``_is_connection_error`` mid-call reconnect semantics
      and is the standard network-retry trade-off.
    - Detecting the swallowed case relies on the session read
      timeout (``MCPServerConfig.timeout``): without one the SDK
      never raises the 408 and a swallowed reset hangs the pending
      request — pre-existing behavior this fix does not change.

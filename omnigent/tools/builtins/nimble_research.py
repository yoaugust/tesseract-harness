"""Built-in tool: nimble_research — Nimble Agent API v2 research runs.

Runs a research task on a Nimble Web Search Agent through the asynchronous
Agent API v2: start a run, poll it to a terminal status, then fetch the cited
result. Returns a bounded JSON envelope with both run identifiers, the output
(prose text or structured JSON), and trust metadata (overall confidence,
consulted sources, per-claim citations). A run can take minutes; the tool
blocks its worker thread and enforces its ``timeout_seconds`` deadline
internally (a dispatched call cannot be interrupted mid-run — it returns by
its clamped deadline).

``agent_id`` is optional, and selects which of the two published create routes
is used:

* omitted — ``POST /v2/agents/runs``. Nimble provisions the agent for this run
  and returns its id. No account agent has to exist first.
* provided — ``POST /v2/agents/{agent_id}/runs``, against an agent you own.

Either way the ``202`` carries both a run ``id`` and a ``web_search_agent_id``.
The **returned** agent id — never the configured one — is what the subsequent
status and result requests are addressed to, because on the generic route it
is the only id that exists. When both are present and disagree, the run is
rejected rather than silently re-pointed at the configured agent.

Run creation is billable and not idempotent, and the API exposes no idempotency
key, so the create call is issued exactly once and never retried — on any
outcome, including transport errors, 408, 409, 429, and 5xx. Retries are
confined to the read-only calls, each within a bounded budget: polling retries
transport errors, 408, 429, and 5xx, while the result call re-checks only the
documented 409 (completed, but the result is not materialized yet).

Some create failures leave the billing outcome unknown — a transport error or
timeout may still have been received, and 408/5xx reached Nimble before failing
— while a 202 carrying an unusable body means the run was definitely created.
Those errors say so explicitly and tell the caller not to resubmit, pointing at
the run id when one survived and at the account's run history when none did. A
clear rejection (401/403/404/422) created nothing and carries no such warning, and a
create-time 429 is treated the same way: a rate limiter refuses the request before a run
is started, so there is nothing to reconcile. Once creation succeeds the run exists and is
billed, so every later failure — timeout, polling, result fetch — carries the same
do-not-resubmit guidance, keyed to the run id.

Effort is optional. When omitted, Nimble applies the selected agent/template
default (the documented product default is ``high``; template defaults vary).
The generally available ``low``, ``medium``, ``high``, and ``x-high`` tiers
can be selected per run. The schema-visible ``max`` value is a coming-soon
custom-budget capability and is not offered as a selectable tier. If supplied
directly, it stops before create with product-team guidance and is never
silently substituted.

Requires the optional ``nimble`` extra (``pip install 'omnigent[nimble]'``);
the nimble-python client is imported lazily, so the base install never
needs it.

Configured in the agent spec::

    tools:
      builtins:
        - name: nimble_research
          api_key: ${NIMBLE_API_KEY}
          # optional:
          # agent_id: wsa_...          # omit to let Nimble provision the agent
          # timeout_seconds: 300
          # poll_interval_seconds: 10

Per-call ``input_data``, ``output_schema``, and ``sources`` are exposed as tool
arguments and forwarded unchanged on both create routes, for enrichment,
structured output, and source guidance respectively.

Released ``nimble-python`` 1.2 typed fields ``skill``, ``use_case``, and
``agent_name`` are exposed per run and forwarded through the SDK on both
create routes. No ``extra_body`` escape hatch is used.

Event streaming (``enable_events``) and ``previous_interaction_id`` are not
exposed here.

"""Built-in tool: sys_list_models — per-worker model availability.

Registers alongside the sub-agent dispatch surface so an orchestrator
can deterministically learn which models each worker (and it itself)
can run before passing an ``args.model`` to ``sys_session_send``. The
enumeration logic lives in :mod:`omnigent.models.model_catalog`; the runner
dispatches this tool locally (see ``omnigent/runner/tool_dispatch.py``)
and the in-process path runs the same enumerator via :meth:`invoke`.

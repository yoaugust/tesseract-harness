"""
LLM-callable timer builtins.

Two tools:

- :class:`SysTimerSetTool` (``sys_timer_set``) — schedules a timer
  that fires a notification after a delay.
- :class:`SysTimerCancelTool` (``sys_timer_cancel``) — cancels a
  previously scheduled timer by ``timer_id``.

Both tools are gated on the agent spec's top-level ``timers:`` flag
(see :attr:`AgentSpec.timers`, defaulting to ``False``).

These classes own the LLM-facing schema and argument validation.
The firing itself runs in the runner: ``execute_tool`` intercepts
``sys_timer_set`` / ``sys_timer_cancel`` and dispatches to
:func:`omnigent.runner.tool_dispatch._execute_timer_set` /
``_execute_timer_cancel``, which run the sleep-and-wake loop and own
the per-session timer registry. The shared :func:`validate_timer_set_args`
helper keeps both surfaces rejecting the same inputs.

The tools are **synchronous** (``is_async() == False``): the LLM
gets the ``timer_id`` back immediately so it can later cancel by ID.
A firing arrives as a hidden ``[System: timer X fired]`` meta message
that wakes the session on the normal ingest path.

Invoked in-process (off the runner dispatch path) these tools have no
timer registry to schedule or cancel against, so ``invoke`` validates
its arguments and then reports that no timer was scheduled or found
rather than raising.

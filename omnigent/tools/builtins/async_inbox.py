"""
LLM-callable async-dispatch builtins.

Step 11 of the harness contract introduces a small set of tools
the LLM uses to manage long-running work via the inbox pattern
instead of polling. This module ships:

- :class:`SysCallAsyncTool` (11a.i) — dispatch a local Python tool
  as a background workflow.
- :class:`SysReadInboxTool` (11a.ii) — pull-mode drain of completed
  async-work payloads.
- :class:`SysCancelAsyncTool` (11a.iii) — cancel a dispatched
  task by its handle id; thin alias over the always-registered
  ``sys_cancel_task``.

All tools in this module are gated on the agent's top-level
``async:`` flag (see :attr:`AgentSpec.async_enabled`). The flag
**defaults to ``True``** to match the legacy inner stack's
default (``omnigent/inner/datamodel.py::AgentDef.async_enabled``),
so agents that don't mention it still see the async surface and
the same YAML produces the same tool list under Omnigent mode and the
legacy path. Agents that explicitly want a minimal-tools surface
declare ``async: false`` to suppress all three.

See ``designs/SERVER_HARNESS_CONTRACT.md`` §Async work + inbox
for the protocol design and the rationale for the inbox-vs-poll
flip.

class SysCallAsyncTool(Tool):
    """
    Dispatch any local Python tool as a background task.

    The LLM passes the target tool's name and a JSON-encoded
    arguments string; this meta-tool spawns the target via the
    runner-side async-task machinery that powers the
    legacy ``@tool(synchronous=False)`` decoration. The handle
    returned to the LLM describes the TARGET tool's task — the
    LLM never sees a handle for ``sys_call_async`` itself.

    Limitations (intentional v1):

    - Only **local Python tools** can be dispatched. MCP tools,
      builtins, and client-side tools fall through with an
      ``unknown_tool`` or ``unsupported_tool`` error. The
      restriction matches the inner Session's pre-existing async
      surface and keeps the dispatch path narrow.
    - ``sys_call_async`` itself is NOT a valid target. Recursive
      meta-dispatch would let the LLM build infinite handle chains
      with no useful semantic; reject explicitly.

    The handle round-trip uses ``handle_id`` as the canonical
    identifier (cancel via ``sys_cancel_async`` with that same
    field). Runner dispatch also echoes ``task_id`` with an
    identical value as a compatibility alias (remove in 0.8.0) for
    clients that still read the older field name — prefer
    ``handle_id``; do not confuse it with
    :class:`SysCancelTaskTool`'s distinct ``task_id`` contract.

    Handle fields:

    - ``handle_id`` — the freshly created async-work handle id
      (canonical; pass to ``sys_cancel_async``).
    - ``task_id`` — compatibility alias, identical to ``handle_id``;
      remove in 0.8.0.
    - ``tool_name`` — the TARGET tool's name (not
      ``"sys_call_async"``).
    - ``status`` — ``"in_progress"``.
    - ``message`` — the canonical async-handle instruction
      string the LLM keys off of (G12).

    The LLM calls this proactively to pull every

    parent workflow's inbox since the last drain. The
    returned text is a concatenation of ``[System: task ...]``

    Why an explicit tool: AP's auto-collect drain runs at the top
    of every loop iteration (see ``_drain_async_completions``).
    That's enough on its own when the LLM finishes a turn and the
    framework gets another shot. But mid-turn, a long chain of

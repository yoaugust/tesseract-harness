"""Codex's model vocabulary, and how to speak it.

Omnigent routes to servable catalog ids (``databricks-gpt-5-6-luna``), but
codex names the same model ``gpt-5.6-luna`` — the version segment is dotted
where the catalog hyphenates it. Two paths need the translation, and they need
it from opposite directions:

**Spawns** (``spawn_agent``). Codex validates ``model`` **client-side**,
against its own bundled catalog, before any request leaves the CLI. A catalog
id is rejected outright (probed live on codex 0.145.0)::

    Unknown model `databricks-gpt-5-6-luna` for spawn_agent.
    Available models: gpt-5.6-sol, gpt-5.6-terra, gpt-5.6-luna, gpt-5.5, gpt-5.2

The same validation caps the effort per model, again client-side::

    Reasoning effort `xhigh` is not supported for model `system.ai.glm-5-2`.
    Supported reasoning efforts: low, medium, high

so a session default of ``xhigh`` kills a GLM spawn unless the spawn's own
``reasoning_effort`` is clamped alongside its model. Models outside codex's
bundled catalog (GLM) have no slug until the session's codex-home extends the
catalog — see :data:`EXTENDED_CATALOG_MODELS`. :func:`codex_spawn_model`
returns ``None`` for anything else, and the caller falls open rather than
sending a value the CLI drops.

**Turns** (``thread/setModel`` on a live thread). Here codex is its own
vocabulary authority: the live ``model/list`` response IS the mapping, so
:func:`codex_reachable_model_slug` hardcodes no model id. Extended-catalog
rows (``system.ai.glm-5-2``) are listed under the catalog spelling, so they
translate to themselves.

An id no row matches is not reachable from this pane, and the function returns
``None`` rather than the id: the routing decision comes from a server-side
gateway map that can name a model this pane's gateway does not actually serve,
and switching onto one of those is a silent drop at the next turn. Declining
the switch keeps the pane on a model it can run and puts the reason where
someone can read it — the same posture the claude side takes when a routed
model has no spelling its picker accepts.

Stdlib-only so hook subprocesses can import it on the spawn/routing paths.

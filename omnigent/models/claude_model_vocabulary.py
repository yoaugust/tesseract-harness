"""Claude Code's model vocabulary, and how to speak it.

Omnigent routes to servable catalog ids (``databricks-claude-sonnet-5``),
but two Claude Code surfaces accept only the family *aliases*:

* the ``Agent`` / ``Task`` tool's ``model`` parameter — a closed enum
  (``sonnet``, ``opus``, ``haiku``, ``fable``), so a catalog id fails
  schema validation and the spawn dies before it starts;
* the ``/model`` slash command — an alias (or the custom slot's exact id)
  resolves offline with no validation; ANY other value, catalog id or
  canonical vendor id alike, is accepted only if a live one-token request
  to the configured endpoint succeeds, so it depends on the gateway
  answering mid-turn and fails as a network error otherwise.

Claude Code resolves each alias to a concrete id via the workspace's
``ANTHROPIC_DEFAULT_*_MODEL`` env (set by omnigent's launch config), so
inverting that mapping is exact — and only exact: a family segment alone
is not enough, because a workspace serving two generations of a family
pins the alias to the newer one, and speaking the alias would run a model
nobody routed to. Both surfaces fail OPEN on an id with no accepted
spelling: skip the switch rather than send something the CLI drops.

``--model`` at launch is a different contract: it takes any string
verbatim, so a session STARTS on an exact id without needing a pin.

Stdlib-only so hook subprocesses can import it on the spawn path.

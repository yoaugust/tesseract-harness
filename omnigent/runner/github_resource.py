"""GitHub integration for the session workspace, backed by the ``gh`` CLI.

Powers the session PR selector, details, and link/unlink actions. Tracked PRs
use explicit host/repository/number identities. Branch and commit discovery
remains a fallback for sessions without recorded PRs. Files and patches come
from GitHub; recording an association does not modify the remote PR.

Design notes:

- Commands run via plain :func:`subprocess.run` in the workspace root, NOT the
  sandboxed OS-env shell helper. The helper strips secrets from the environment,
  which would break ``gh`` auth; a plain subprocess inherits the runner process
  environment, so ``gh`` authenticates as it normally does — the developer's
  ``gh`` login in local dev, and in a managed sandbox the per-user ``hosts.yml``
  that :func:`omnigent.git_credential_github.configure_host_gh` writes from the
  credential broker at host startup. In a sandbox we additionally scrub
  ``GH_TOKEN``/``GITHUB_TOKEN`` from ``gh``'s env (gh ranks those *above*
  ``hosts.yml``), so a stray ambient token — e.g. a gh-MCP env passthrough —
  can't silently make the panel act as a shared identity instead of the
  connected owner. Outside a sandbox the env is inherited untouched.
- The list and patch are GitHub-computed, never a local ``git diff``, so a stale
  local ``origin/<base>`` can't inflate them with files outside the PR.
- Expanded context uses the selected PR's head and merge-base commits through
  GitHub, including fork heads and renames. Legacy calls without a session
  continue to read local git objects.
- The branch→PR lookup is a ``gh pr view --json`` (``--json`` avoids the
  interactive pager and the Projects-classic mis-parse of a bare view), backed by
  a commit-identity fallback for when the remote branch name is decoupled from the
  checkout. Fork / triangular PRs resolve once the two coordinates they turn on
  are set explicitly: the base repo (``gh repo set-default``, which ``gh`` stores
  in ``.git/config`` as ``remote.<name>.gh-resolved``) and the head owner (the
  authenticated account). The panel surfaces an account + remote selector so the
  user pins both; a per-repo account preference (``~/.omnigent/config.yaml``) is
  applied by running each ``gh`` call as the chosen account —
  ``GH_TOKEN=$(gh auth token --user <login>)`` — outside a sandbox (inside one we
  keep the single broker identity).
- When a stacking tool (git-stack, ``git pp``) pushes under a remote branch name
  that differs from the local checkout and leaves no upstream tracking, ``gh``'s
  branch-name lookup misses. The pushed commit is the invariant that still links
  the checkout to its PR, so the fallback asks GitHub which PR a pushed commit
  belongs to (``repos/{owner}/{repo}/commits/{sha}/pulls``), querying the repo it
  was pushed to (the fork for a fork PR) — see :func:`_resolve_pr_via_commit`.
- ``available: false`` payloads let the tab render a message ("gh not installed",
  "not a git repo") instead of surfacing an error.

    """Return the branch's PR as a ``gh``-JSON object for ``fields``, or ``None``.

    Two-step, so a decoupled remote branch name never hides the PR:

    1. ``gh pr view --json`` — resolves the current branch's PR against the
       gh-resolved base as the authenticated account. Fast, and covers same-repo
       branches and any push that set upstream tracking (plain ``push -u``, and
       ``git pp``, which pushes ``-u``). ``--json`` also avoids the interactive
       pager and the Projects-classic mis-parse of a bare ``gh pr view``.
    2. Commit-identity fallback — when a stacking tool (git-stack, ``git pp``)
       pushed under a remote branch name that differs from the checkout, or a
       fork PR whose head ``gh`` can't name, the branch-name lookup misses. The
       pushed commit still maps to the PR (:func:`_resolve_pr_via_commit`), which
       also yields the PR's base repo so the full object is fetched with an
       explicit ``-R``. This subsumes the old ``branch.<name>.merge`` head guess.

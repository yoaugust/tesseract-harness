"""A copy-on-write forkserver ("zygote") for runner processes.

Every session today spawns a fresh ``python -m omnigent.runner._entry``, each
paying the full import floor (omnigent's graph + pydantic/fastapi/httpx) — on a
host running N sessions that floor is duplicated N times. This module collapses
it: a single long-lived zygote imports the runner graph ONCE, then ``os.fork()``s
a child per session. On Linux the shared read-only import pages are copy-on-write,
so each additional runner costs only the pages it dirties, not another ~120MB.

The zygote is launched by the host daemon (``omnigent/host/connect.py``) as a
plain ``subprocess.Popen`` child — a fresh interpreter, so it inherits none of
the daemon's asyncio loop, websocket, or worker threads (forking from a
multithreaded async process would deadlock the child). It is single-threaded,
holds no event loop and no network sockets, and blocks on one ``AF_UNIX``
control socket handed to it by the daemon.

Protocol (newline-delimited JSON, one request → one response):

  {"cmd": "ping"}                          -> {"pong": true}
  {"cmd": "fork", "env": {...},            -> {"pid": 12345}
   "log_path": "/…/runner-ab12.log"}          or {"error": "..."}
  {"cmd": "poll", "pid": 12345}            -> {"returncode": 0} | {"returncode": null}

The forked child closes the control socket, points stdio at the session log
file, applies the request's env into ``os.environ``, and calls the unchanged
``omnigent.runner._entry.main()`` — so it behaves exactly like a cold
``python -m omnigent.runner._entry``.

**Parent-pid contract:** the runner's parent-death watchdog treats
``os.getppid() != RUNNER_PARENT_PID`` as "orphaned" (see
``omnigent/runner/_entry.py``). A zygote-forked runner's OS parent is the
*zygote*, so the daemon MUST set ``RUNNER_PARENT_PID`` to the zygote's pid, not
its own. When the daemon dies, the control socket hits EOF, the zygote exits,
its runner children reparent, ``getppid()`` changes, and each runner tears
itself down — preserving today's parent-death semantics through one extra hop.

POSIX (the gate is ``IS_POSIX``): the fork path runs on macOS too, though the
copy-on-write savings are Linux-specific. On by default; set
``OMNIGENT_RUNNER_ZYGOTE=0`` to opt out. The daemon falls back to direct
``Popen`` if the zygote is unavailable, so this is never a hard dependency.

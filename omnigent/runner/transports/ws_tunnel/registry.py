"""Server-side registry of live runner WebSocket tunnels (Phase 4).

Per ``designs/RUNNER.md`` §2 "Server-side registry" + §3 "Adapters
on each side", the server keeps an in-memory registry mapping
``runner_id`` → live WebSocket. The :class:`WSTunnelTransport`
looks up the ``WebSocket`` for a given runner, sends a frame, and
reads response frames back via per-`req_id` reassembly queues
managed here.

This module ships:
- :class:`RunnerSession`: per-runner state (live WS, advertised
  capabilities, last-frame-received time, in-flight req_ids).
- :class:`TunnelRegistry`: thread-safe (asyncio-safe) map of
  runner_id → RunnerSession + per-(runner_id, req_id) reassembly
  queues.
- :class:`WebSocketLike`: minimal protocol that real WebSockets and
  test fakes both satisfy. Lets the transport-level code be
  unit-tested without a real network.

Lifecycle: :meth:`register` is called when a fresh tunnel opens;
:meth:`deregister` is called on tunnel close. While registered, the
server can :meth:`route_response_frame` to drop an incoming
``response.*`` frame into the right reassembly queue, and the
transport calls :meth:`open_request` / :meth:`close_request` to
manage per-request lifecycle.

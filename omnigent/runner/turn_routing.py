"""In-harness first-message turn routing: loopback endpoint + replay.

The sibling of :mod:`omnigent.runner.subagent_routing`, for the MAIN
agent's model rather than a subagent spawn. A harness
``UserPromptSubmit`` hook calls this before the first real user prompt
runs to ask which model the session should be on. The gate is
**advisory**: every transport failure, unreachable endpoint, unparseable
verdict or router outage lets the prompt run unrouted, because a turn
that dies on routing infrastructure is worse than a turn on the launch
model. Two halves live here:

* **Runner side** — a loopback HTTP relay (:func:`start_turn_router`) on
  ``127.0.0.1:0``, bearer-token authenticated, advertised to the hook via
  ``turn_router.json`` in the session bridge dir. It also owns the
  **replay** (:func:`schedule_replay`), because only the runner can see
  the harness's turn bookkeeping.
* **Server side** — the policy (:func:`resolve_turn_route`), which runs
  where ``RuntimeCaps.routing_client`` lives, pins ``model_override`` and
  records the decision chip.

The two halves are joined by the server relay route
:data:`SERVER_ROUTE_PATH` (registered in
``omnigent/server/routes/sessions/routes_hooks.py``); the runner's
handler forwards to it with :func:`make_server_relay_resolver`.

**The authoritative gate is** :func:`already_routed` — the session's
routing-decision label. The hook's local :data:`MARKER_FILE` is only a
fast skip that saves a round trip; it is never the source of truth, and it
is scoped to the session that wrote it because the bridge dir it lives in
outlives that session (``/clear`` rotations, forks).

**Block-and-replay.** Neither harness can retarget the turn that is
already in flight — codex binds the turn's model before
``UserPromptSubmit`` runs (design plan §3b, spike S1), and claude's hook
output carries no model at all. So the hook blocks the prompt, the switch
is applied while nothing is running, and this module replays the captured
prompt as a normal user turn — which then runs routed. The two harnesses
differ only in *who* applies the switch: codex's hook does it over the
app-server RPC, while claude's must be done from the runner
(:func:`_apply_routed_model`) because the pane is frozen on the hook. The
ordering handshake is documented on :func:`schedule_replay`.

Once the hook blocks, the prompt exists **only** in the replay, and the
block marker stops any later hook from asking again — so a replay that
never lands loses the prompt for good and leaves the session with a
routing chip and no turn. :data:`PENDING_FILE` is the durability half:
the prompt is recorded before the block and cleared once it is delivered,
and :func:`schedule_pending_replay_recovery` drains whatever a dead
launch left behind.

**Timeout budget.** Four hops wait on each other, so each one's budget is
strictly larger than the hop it waits on — otherwise an inner hop's
fail-open branch can never run. Canonical values, outermost first:

1. harness hook timeout — :data:`HARNESS_HOOK_TIMEOUT_S` (15s, registered
   on each harness's ``UserPromptSubmit`` entry)
2. hook script HTTP request + model switch —
   :data:`HOOK_REQUEST_TIMEOUT_S` (8s) then
   :data:`SETTINGS_UPDATE_TIMEOUT_S` (5s)
3. runner loopback relay wait — :data:`RELAY_TIMEOUT_S` (7s)
4. server relay hop — :data:`SERVER_HOP_TIMEOUT_S` (6s)

Inside hop 4 sits the routing call itself
(:data:`omnigent.server.smart_routing.ROUTING_REQUEST_TIMEOUT_S`, 5s).

**The ladder is tight on purpose.** This is a hazard path: the prompt is
frozen in the pane until the hook answers, so a fail-open that takes 30
seconds is blocking in practice even though nothing errored. Every step is
one second, from the 5s routing call outwards, so a wedged server costs a
visible pause rather than a hang — and each hop still has room to run its
own fail-open branch before the hop above it gives up.

    Ordering — the block must be in effect before the replay lands, and
    the prompt must run exactly once. Two file-mediated handshakes with
    the hook do that, both bounded:

    1. **Did the hook actually block?** The hook writes
       :data:`MARKER_FILE` immediately before it emits its block, so the
       marker means "the prompt was dropped, you owe it a replay". No
       marker inside :data:`REPLAY_MARKER_WAIT_S` means the hook fell open,
       the prompt already ran on the old model, and the replay is
       abandoned — a double-run is the one outcome worse than an unrouted
       turn.
    2. **Has the blocked prompt cleared?** :func:`_settle_probe` answers
       that per harness. Delivering into an aborting turn would steer it
       instead of starting a fresh routed one. Once the wait expires the
       prompt is delivered anyway: losing it is worse than delivering it
       early.

    Then, on harnesses whose hook could not apply the model itself, the
    switch happens here (:func:`_apply_routed_model`) — after the block is
    in effect and before the prompt exists, so nothing races it.

    Finally the prompt goes through the **normal events path** — the same
    ``POST /v1/sessions/{id}/events`` the web composer uses — so it is
    persisted, mirrored and executed like any other user turn. That path
    re-checks the routing gate and finds ``model_override`` pinned, so it
    routes nothing and records no second decision.

    The delivery carries the routed model as the event's own
    ``model_override``. That is what makes claude route: its hook cannot
    switch the model, so the switch has to ride the replayed turn, where
    the executor types ``/model`` under its inject lock before the message.
    Codex has already switched its own thread by then, and re-asserting the
    same model there is a no-op.

    :param session_id: Session/conversation identifier.
    :param prompt: The captured prompt text to re-deliver.
    :param bridge_dir: Session bridge directory (marker + bridge state).
    :param blocked_turn_id: Harness turn id the blocked prompt was
        submitted on. ``None`` falls back to the harness's own settle

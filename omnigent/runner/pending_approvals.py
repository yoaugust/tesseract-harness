"""Runner-side registry of asyncio Futures awaiting policy ASK verdicts.

When the runner needs the user to approve a gated tool call, it
mints an ``elicitation_id``, parks a Future here, and waits for the
AP server's approval-event POST to arrive on
``/v1/sessions/{id}/events``. The runner's session-event handler
resolves the Future on receipt.

Lifted out of ``omnigent.runner.app`` so the gate that lives in
``omnigent.runner.tool_dispatch`` can register and wait without
threading the dict through every dispatch entry point. The dict is
process-global; elicitation ids are UUIDs so there's no collision
concern, and an in-flight Future's scope is naturally one approval
round-trip.

Lifecycle contract:

* :func:`register` creates a Future and inserts it. Returns the
  Future so the caller can await it (typically wrapped in
  :func:`asyncio.wait_for`).
* The caller MUST call :func:`cleanup` in a ``finally`` block.
  The registry has no GC of its own; leaked entries accumulate.
* :func:`resolve` is called by the session-event handler when an
  ``approval`` event arrives. Idempotent and no-op when the id is
  unknown or the Future is already done.

# than auto-refuse on its own. The old 120s default silently refused (treated
# as DENY) any prompt a user didn't answer within two minutes — the

# a per-policy ``ask_timeout`` should still pass ``timeout_seconds`` explicitly;

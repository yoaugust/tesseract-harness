"""Runner-owned MCP executions that survive a server-tunnel replacement.

The Omnigent server reaches local MCP processes through a tunneled runner
request.  A server restart cancels that request, but it must not cancel and
then replay an external tool that may already have side effects.  This
registry shields the actual execution and lets the next server generation
reattach with the same operation id and step. The originating proxy reserves
the operation until its call ends, so completed steps cannot expire mid-retry.

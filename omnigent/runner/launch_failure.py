"""Classify harness launch/terminal failures into human-readable diagnoses.

When a harness terminal exits unexpectedly (or a launch/connection step
fails), the raw signal is a terse code plus a tail of PTY output — hard to
act on. This module maps that raw signal to a :class:`FailureDiagnosis`
(``title`` / ``cause`` / ``remediation``) the web UI can render as a clear
failure card, and provides English fallbacks for the failure *codes* that
have no output to pattern-match.

The design goal is one shared classification layer for every harness: the
terminal-exit path is common to all ~20 harnesses, so a matcher added here
covers them all. A new harness quirk becomes one entry in
:data:`_TERMINAL_EXIT_MATCHERS`, never per-harness branching.

"""Native-subagent routing: loopback endpoint + server-side policy.

Harness ``PreToolUse`` hooks (Claude ``Task``, Codex ``spawn_agent``) call
this before a native subagent spawn to ask which model the spawn should
run on. The gate is **advisory**: every transport failure, unreachable
endpoint, unparseable verdict or hook timeout allows the spawn unchanged,
because a spawn that dies on routing infrastructure is worse than a spawn
on the inherited model. Two halves live here:

* **Runner side** — a loopback HTTP relay (:func:`start_subagent_router`)
  on ``127.0.0.1:0``, bearer-token authenticated, advertised to hook
  scripts via ``subagent_router.json`` in the session bridge dir. Same
  rendezvous as ``tool_relay.json``.
* **Server side** — the policy (:func:`resolve_subagent_route`), which
  runs where ``RuntimeCaps.routing_client`` lives and persists every
  decision as a ``routing_decision`` transcript item.

The two halves are joined by the server relay route
:data:`SERVER_ROUTE_PATH` (registered in
``omnigent/server/routes/sessions/routes_hooks.py``); the runner's
handler forwards to it with :func:`make_server_relay_resolver`.

**Timeout budget.** Four hops wait on each other, so each one's budget is
strictly larger than the hop it waits on — otherwise an inner hop's
fail-open branch can never run. Canonical values, outermost first:

1. harness hook timeout — 12s (``claude_native_bridge``'s PreToolUse entry,
   codex's spawn hook, and ``HOOK_TIMEOUT_S`` for the in-process claude-sdk
   hook). Strictly larger than hop 2, never equal to it: a hook killed at the
   same instant its request gives up never reaches its fail-open branch.
2. hook script HTTP request — :data:`HOOK_REQUEST_TIMEOUT_S` (8s, defined
   as ``REQUEST_TIMEOUT_S`` in ``omnigent.inner.hook_scripts.subagent_router``,
   which stays stdlib-only and cannot import this module)
3. runner loopback relay wait — :data:`RELAY_TIMEOUT_S` (7s)
4. server relay hop — :data:`SERVER_HOP_TIMEOUT_S` (6s), inside which the
   routing call itself runs on
   :data:`omnigent.server.smart_routing.ROUTING_REQUEST_TIMEOUT_S` (5s)

**The ladder is tight on purpose.** A spawn gate holds the parent agent's
tool call open until it answers, so a fail-open that takes 30 seconds stalls
the agent even though nothing errored. One second per step keeps a wedged
server to a visible pause while leaving every hop room for its own fail-open
branch.

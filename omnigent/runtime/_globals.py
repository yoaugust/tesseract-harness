@dataclass
class DispatchCapability:
    """
    Process-local handle the parent agent workflow registers so
    children spawned by the runner's tool dispatcher can locate
    the parent's runtime state without re-building it.

    Each parent workflow registers ONE :class:`DispatchCapability`
    keyed on its ``task_id`` at workflow start, and unregisters in
    its ``finally``. Concurrent action_required dispatches spawn
    independent child workflows (per
    ``designs/TOOL_DISPATCH_CHILD_WORKFLOWS.md``); each child looks
    up the parent's capability by ``parent_task_id``, executes the
    server-side tool through the parent's :class:`ToolManager`, and
    PATCHes the result back to the harness.

    Why a process-local registry instead of a ContextVar:
    children run in their own asyncio task contexts. ContextVars are
    scoped to the asyncio task / thread that set them, so a child's
    context does not inherit the parent's :data:`_tool_manager_var`
    binding. Pinning the capability under the parent's ``task_id``
    lets the child resolve it explicitly via
    :func:`get_dispatch_capability`.

    :param tool_mgr: The parent's :class:`ToolManager`. Children
        invoke ``tool_mgr.call_tool(name, args, tool_ctx)``
        on a worker thread to execute the tool.
    :param tool_ctx: The :class:`ToolContext` the parent built for
        its own tool invocations. Reused verbatim by children so
        ``ctx.workspace`` / ``ctx.conversation_id`` agree with what
        the harness/LLM saw.
    :param policy_engine: The per-workflow policy engine (``Any``
        because the import would create a cycle here). Reserved
        for the followup that wires TOOL_CALL enforcement into the
        action_required path; currently held for forward
        compatibility.
    :param conversation_id: The conversation the parent runs under,
        e.g. ``"conv_abc123"``. Used by children when they need to
        look up the harness UDS socket via
        :class:`HarnessProcessManager`.
    :param root_task_id: The root task id when the parent is itself
        a sub-agent, ``None`` for top-level parents. Threaded
        through so children can route SSE / signal correctly.
    :param agent_name: The parent's agent name, e.g.
        ``"databricks_coding_agent"``. Used for telemetry and
        log lines on the child side.

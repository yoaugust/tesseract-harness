"""In-process index of un-consumed web-composer user messages.

Backs the optimistic "queued message" bubble for native-terminal
sessions (claude-native / codex-native) so it survives a client
re-bind. On those sessions the Omnigent server does NOT persist a web-typed
user message at POST time — the message is forwarded into the vendor
TUI and the transcript forwarder later mirrors it back as the single
durable writer (see ``_dispatch_session_event_to_runner``). Until that
round-trip completes the message lives nowhere on the server, so a
client that navigates away and back (or whose SSE pump rebinds
mid-flight via ``ensureBoundSession``) loses the optimistic bubble it
rendered locally — it reappears only once the transcript persists it.

This index closes that window with the same shape the codebase already
uses for transient recovery state (:mod:`pending_elicitations`,
:mod:`inflight_text`):

* populated by the route layer on a native web message POST (via
  :func:`record`, before the runner forward), so the message is known
  server-side immediately;
* replayed into the cold-load snapshot (``GET /v1/sessions/{id}``) via
  :func:`snapshot_for`, so a (re)connecting client re-hydrates the
  bubble instead of showing nothing;
* drained when the transcript forwarder persists the matching user
  message (via :func:`resolve_oldest`), so the now-committed item
  doesn't double-render alongside a stale pending entry.

Unlike :mod:`pending_elicitations` / :mod:`inflight_text`, this index
is NOT populated through the :func:`session_stream.publish` chokepoint:
recording needs to return the new entry id to the POST handler (so the
sender can adopt it and dedupe cleanly), and draining needs to run at
the persist site so the ``session.input.consumed`` event can carry the
cleared id. Both are caller-driven, so the access is explicit.

Draining is by FIFO order (oldest first), NOT by text. Native gives no
id channel back through the TUI to correlate the forwarded POST with the
mirrored transcript item, and the transcript freely reformats the text
(reply-quote ``>`` blockquotes, ``[Attached:]`` markers, whitespace), so
matching on text is unreliable — it would leave a reformatted message
stuck pending and double-rendered. Per-session SSE ordering guarantees
the i-th persisted user message corresponds to the i-th queued one, so
each persisted native user message drains the oldest pending entry.

The one imperfect case is interleaving a web-composer message with a
message typed directly in the TUI: the TUI message (which has no pending
entry) drains the oldest web entry, so that web bubble briefly
disappears and reappears once it persists. It self-heals; the committed
bubble always renders the just-persisted content regardless.

Limitations (identical to :mod:`pending_elicitations`):

* In-memory only; multi-replica Omnigent deploys would each see their own
  slice. Session events are already process-affine (``session_stream``
  is in-process with no replay, and a session's runner relay + SSE
  subscribers live on one process), so this rides the same affinity.
* Entries do not survive an AP-server restart — acceptable, the loss
  is one in-flight message, same as every other AP-side transient.

A forwarded message the vendor TUI never accepts (runner crash, dropped
keystrokes) is never persisted, so :func:`resolve_oldest` never
drains its entry. :data:`_TTL_S` bounds that ghost: stale entries are
evicted lazily on the next :func:`record` / :func:`snapshot_for` /
:func:`resolve_oldest` for the same conversation.

class RuntimeCaps:
    """
    Operator-configured runtime policies for agent execution.

    These are deployment/security decisions that agents cannot
    override. Agent specs are clamped to these limits.

    :param execution_timeout: Max wall-clock time for the entire
        agent loop in seconds, e.g. ``7200``.
    :param sandbox_enabled: Whether to use ``srt`` sandboxing for
        local tool execution when available on PATH. ``True`` by
        default. This is a runtime security policy — agents cannot
        opt out. The agent spec controls ``container_image``
        (what container to use) and ``container_runtime`` (docker
        or podman).  The runtime can also be set globally via the
        ``OMNIGENT_CONTAINER_RUNTIME`` environment variable; the
        per-agent ``container_runtime`` key takes precedence.
        Note: ``container_runtime`` determines which binary is
        invoked via subprocess — it is validated to a fixed
        allowlist (``"docker"`` | ``"podman"``) at both the
        dataclass and parser layers.
    :param default_policies: Server-wide policies appended after
        per-agent policies on every session. Loaded from the
        ``policies:`` key in the server ``--config`` YAML
        at startup. ``[]`` means no server-wide policies (the
        default — no behaviour change when the key is absent).
    :param llm: Server-level LLM configuration for policy
        functions. Parsed from the ``llm:`` key in the server
        ``--config`` YAML at startup. When present, a
        :class:`~omnigent.policies.types.PolicyLLMClient`
        is built from this config and injected into every
        function policy's ``event["llm_client"]``.
        ``None`` when the key is absent — function policies
        see ``None`` in ``event["llm_client"]``.
    :param policy_llm_connection_factory: Optional callable invoked
        at engine-build time (i.e. per request) to supply the
        ``{"base_url", "api_key"}`` connection dict for the
        :class:`~omnigent.policies.types.PolicyLLMClient`. When
        provided its result takes precedence over any connection
        resolved from ``llm.connection`` / ``llm.profile``, so the
        LLM call is billed to the request caller rather than a
        static service-level credential. ``None`` falls back to the
        ``llm``-config-resolved connection.
    :param routing_client: This deployment's primary/default routing
        client — the same object as ``routing_backends.any()`` when both
        are set. Every legacy consumer reads it, so it stays the single
        answer to "is routing configured at all".
    :param routing_backends: The external and built-in routing clients
        as a pair, so a call whose harness is not AI-Gateway-backed can
        still be served by the built-in judge
        (:func:`~omnigent.server.routing_backend.select_router`).
        Managed deployments that supply their own client should set this
        explicitly: absent it the pair is derived from
        :attr:`routing_client` by ``isinstance``, which classifies an
        unrecognized client as the OSS judge. That default is safe — it
        costs only a badge on the decision chip, whereas claiming a
        custom client is gateway-backed would promise reachability
        nobody verified.

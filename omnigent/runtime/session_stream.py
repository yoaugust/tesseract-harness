"""Pure pub-sub in-process live stream for real-time SSE delivery.

This module is a fan-out broadcaster keyed by ``conversation_id``.
Every active call to :func:`subscribe` owns its own bounded ephemeral
``asyncio.Queue``; :func:`publish` fans the event out to all queues
currently subscribed to that conversation_id. A subscriber that falls
behind past the bound is disconnected so it can recover through the
snapshot + live-tail reconnect contract. Events emitted before any
subscriber is connected are LOST — there is no buffer and no replay.
Clients that need to recover state across a disconnect fetch
``GET /v1/sessions/{id}`` for the persisted history and dedupe by item id.

This module owns no per-conversation lifecycle. There is no
``register`` / ``unregister`` step: the first ``subscribe`` call
lazily creates a subscriber slot, and the last ``subscribe`` to
exit removes the slot in its ``finally`` block.

Producer (workflow thread, sync):
    publish(conversation_id, event)  — thread-safe broadcast
    close(conversation_id)           — broadcasts end-of-stream
                                       to all active subscribers

Consumer (SSE endpoint, async):
    subscribe(conversation_id) -> AsyncIterator  — yields events

    Subscribe to live events for a conversation.

    Creates a fresh bounded ephemeral queue for this subscriber, registers
    it under ``conversation_id``, and yields events as they arrive
    from :func:`publish`. Ends when :func:`close` broadcasts the
    end-of-stream sentinel or when the caller stops iterating
    (e.g. client disconnect cancels the generator). The
    ``finally`` block always unregisters this subscriber slot so
    a stale queue cannot keep accumulating events.

    If the subscriber falls more than
    :data:`_SUBSCRIBER_QUEUE_MAX_EVENTS` events behind, its queued backlog
    is replaced with an overflow signal and this iterator raises
    :class:`SubscriberOverflowError`. HTTP/SSE callers treat that as a
    dropped transport and reconnect through the persisted snapshot rather
    than retaining an unbounded in-memory backlog.

    Live-tail only: events emitted before this call are NOT
    replayed. Multiple concurrent subscribers to the same
    conversation each see every event independently — there is
    no contention between them.

    Must be called from the asyncio event loop that the caller
    intends to iterate on; the sync producer side uses
    ``loop.call_soon_threadsafe`` to enqueue across threads.

        has been idle for this many seconds. Heartbeats are
        generated locally inside this subscriber and never enter
        the publish path, so multiple subscribers each get their
        own independent cadence. ``None`` (default) preserves the
        pure event-driven shape used by harness-internal
        consumers that don't need keepalive.
    :param ready_event: Optional event yielded immediately after
        this subscriber's slot is registered, e.g.
        ``{"type": "session.heartbeat"}``. This gives HTTP/SSE
        clients a subscription acknowledgment before an expensive
        snapshot hook runs, while still registering the live-tail
        queue before any producer can publish a turn event.
    :param pre_ready_snapshot: Optional SYNC hook run once, immediately
        after slot registration and before any ``yield``/``await``. Its
        events are yielded ahead of the live tail. Unlike ``on_subscribed``
        this must be synchronous: it is the only place a dedup-sensitive
        snapshot can be read while still partitioning exactly against the
        live tail, because no ``publish`` can interleave before the first
        suspension. Use it for the in-flight assistant-text replay;
        reading that from ``on_subscribed`` (after ``yield ready_event``)
        double-renders deltas streamed in the gap. Best-effort:
        exceptions are swallowed so a failing snapshot never blocks the
        live tail. ``None`` skips it.
    :param on_subscribed: Optional async hook run once, right after this
        subscriber's slot is registered and before the first live event
        is awaited. Its returned event dicts are yielded as a
        snapshot-on-connect ahead of the live tail. Registering the slot
        first guarantees no delta is dropped between snapshot and tail.

        never blocks live delivery. ``None`` skips the snapshot.

"""Per-user fan-out for session-list discovery events.

The ``WS /v1/sessions/updates`` push stream is *client-driven*: a browser
watches only the session ids it already has cached, so it can keep those rows
fresh but can never learn about a session created somewhere else (another tab,
the CLI, or one shared with the user) — that id was never in its watch-set.

This module closes that gap with a push instead of a poll. It is a tiny
fan-out broadcaster keyed by a *user key* (the authenticated user id, or a
shared sentinel in single-user mode): when a session becomes accessible to a
user, the HTTP route :func:`publish`es a ``session_added`` event, and every one
of that user's connected updates streams (each an async :func:`subscribe`)
wakes and pushes the new session to its browser. The browser then reconciles it
into the sidebar — so a new session appears within a tick of being created, and
an idle list still makes zero HTTP polls.

Mirrors :mod:`omnigent.runtime.session_stream` (the per-conversation SSE
broadcaster) but is deliberately minimal: no replay buffer, no end-of-stream
sentinel, no snapshot hooks, and no side-channels. Events emitted while a user
has no stream connected are simply dropped — that user's next page load fetches
the list over HTTP anyway, so there is nothing to recover. Kept free of
``omnigent.runtime`` imports so it can't introduce an import cycle.

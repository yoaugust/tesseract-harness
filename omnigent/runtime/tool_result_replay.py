"""Normalize persisted tool results for safe replay.

Claude-native forks and cold resumes rebuild stored MCP results into Anthropic
content blocks. Image attachments must be normalized so Claude receives one
structured image—not another base64 copy from ``toolUseResult`` metadata.
Otherwise image-heavy histories can exceed the context limit before compaction;
one affected session produced ~2.17M tokens against Claude's 1M-token maximum.

Handles text, single or mixed MCP image blocks, newline-joined results, error
prefixes, and malformed or store-truncated images. Valid images are preserved;
unsafe partial payloads become bounded placeholders. Kept stdlib-only so replay
and compaction paths can import it safely.

    data: Invalid symbol 91, offset 0`` — the leading ``[``). Any image block
    whose payload no longer validates is turned into the omitted-image text
    placeholder; a still-valid one is canonicalized so a wrapped or unpadded
    spelling cannot fail the resume either.

    Traversal is deliberately narrow — a message content list and, within it, a
    ``tool_result``'s ``content`` list. It does not descend into a
    ``tool_use.input`` or other arbitrary structured value, so a nested payload
    that merely *looks* like ``{"type": "image", ...}`` (e.g. an image tool's
    arguments) is never rewritten.

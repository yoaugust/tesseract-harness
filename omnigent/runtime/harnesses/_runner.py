"""
Generic ``python -m`` entrypoint for harness subprocesses.

Invoked by :class:`omnigent.runtime.harnesses.process_manager.HarnessProcessManager`
with four required arguments (plus one optional):

- ``--harness <name>``: human-readable harness name, e.g.
  ``"claude-sdk"``. Stashed on ``app.state.harness`` for
  introspection / logging; not used for module resolution.
- ``--module <python_path>``: importable module that exports
  ``create_app() -> FastAPI``. The parent looks this up from
  :data:`omnigent.runtime.harnesses._HARNESS_MODULES` before
  spawning, so the registry stays the single source of truth in
  the parent process (necessary because subprocesses don't
  inherit registry mutations from their parent's runtime).
- ``--socket <path>``: absolute Unix socket path the process binds.
  AP's per-conversation HTTP client points at the same path via
  :class:`httpx.AsyncHTTPTransport(uds=...)`.
- ``--conversation-id <id>``: the conversation this process serves.
  Stashed on ``app.state.conversation_id`` so the harness can scope
  its in-memory state per §Harness in-memory state in the design
  doc. Omnigent allocates the id; the runner does NOT parse it from the
  socket path (the socket layout is a process-manager
  implementation detail, not a stable contract).
- ``--parent-pid <pid>`` (optional): PID of the spawning process.
  When supplied, a daemon thread checks that this process is still
  parented by that PID and polls ``os.kill(pid, 0)`` every second.
  It sends ``SIGTERM`` to this process when the parent disappears
  or the OS reparents the runner.

The runner is intentionally minimal — configure logging, import,
factory call, state stash, uvicorn launch. All harness-specific
behavior lives in the per-harness ``create_app()`` factory.

Logging is configured here rather than per harness so every harness
child's logs land in a file an operator can read (see
:func:`_configure_logging`); a child with no handler falls back to
``logging.lastResort``, which drops everything below WARNING.

See ``designs/SERVER_HARNESS_CONTRACT.md`` §Required harness
package shape and §Process management.

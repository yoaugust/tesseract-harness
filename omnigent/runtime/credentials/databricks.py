"""
Databricks workspace credential resolver.

This module provides a single entry point, :func:`resolve_databricks_workspace`,
that returns a populated :class:`WorkspaceCreds` (workspace host and bearer
token) by checking, in order:

1. The ``databricks-sdk``'s :class:`~databricks.sdk.config.Config`
   resolver. This handles every ``auth_type`` in ``~/.databrickscfg``
   (``pat``, ``databricks-cli`` / OAuth-U2M, service-principal OAuth,
   Azure CLI, env-OIDC, metadata-service, etc.) and mints a fresh
   bearer token via ``Config.authenticate()``. Critical for OAuth
   profiles whose cfg sections have NO static ``token`` field.
2. The named profile section in the Databricks config file via
   raw configparser (``~/.databrickscfg`` by default, or the path in
   ``DATABRICKS_CONFIG_FILE`` if that env var is set). Only finds
   creds when both ``host`` and ``token`` are present in plain text.
3. The ``[DEFAULT]`` section of the same config file via raw
   configparser, used either when no profile is requested or when
   the requested profile is missing.

If none of the above yield both a host and a token, the resolver raises
``OSError`` with a message that lists every source it tried.

Note: this resolver intentionally does NOT honor ``OPENAI_BASE_URL`` /
``OPENAI_API_KEY``. Those env vars are used by the *OpenAI* client paths
(serving endpoints, openai-agents harness) and ALREADY contain the full
serving-endpoints URL. Callers of this resolver need the bare workspace
host so they can append their own path (e.g. ``/serving-endpoints``);
reusing a full OpenAI base URL would produce malformed URLs, so we
resolve via the SDK and cfg file only.

The SDK-based path mirrors (but does not import from)
``omnigent/inner/databricks_executor.py:_read_databrickscfg``. The
configparser fallback mirrors ``_read_databrickscfg_file_fallback`` in
the same module. Once the ``inner/`` package is sunset (see
``designs/UNIFICATION.md``), both functions there should be deleted in
favor of calling this helper.

**v1 limitation (documented):** the SDK-minted token is fetched once
per call and then cached in the returned :class:`WorkspaceCreds`. OAuth
access tokens typically expire after ~1 hour. Long-running sessions
will therefore hit expiry mid-stream. v2 will refactor callers to
hold the SDK ``Config`` object and re-call ``authenticate()`` on
demand (which performs refresh-token handling transparently).

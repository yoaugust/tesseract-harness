"""
Agent-plane observability using the OpenTelemetry SDK directly.

See ``designs/OBSERVABILITY.md`` for the full design. The module
is intentionally thin — it holds only the omnigent-specific
concerns:

* **Trace ID derivation from the response ID.** Agent-plane response
  IDs are ``resp_<32-char hex>``. We reuse the hex suffix as the
  W3C trace ID so operators can look up a trace by its response ID
  without a lookup table. :func:`trace_context_for_response` injects
  a synthetic ``traceparent`` via the W3C TraceContext propagator.

* **Runtime init.** :func:`init` installs an OTLP ``TracerProvider``
  when ``OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT`` is set. When the endpoint is
  absent, tracing is still enabled so operators who install their own
  provider externally get spans for free; the default no-op provider
  discards them silently.

* **Subprocess trace propagation.** :func:`get_traceparent_env`
  serializes the current trace context into env vars the executor
  subprocess launchers can merge into their child process env.

* **A handful of record helpers** where the work is non-trivial
  (LLM usage normalization, cancellation tagging). Trivial
  operations like ``span.set_attribute(...)`` are called directly
  at instrumentation sites.

    installed, no instrumentation is wired, and no spans are created, so
    a default install incurs zero telemetry cost. Set it truthy to opt
    in; ``OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT`` then selects the export target.

    Safe to call multiple times; the second and subsequent calls
    refresh the content-capture flag but do not re-register providers.

    :param service_name: The OpenTelemetry ``service.name`` for this
        process, e.g. ``"omni-server"`` / ``"omni-runner"`` /
        ``"omni-harness"`` / ``"omni-host"``. Each entrypoint names
        itself so the trace backend can attribute spans to a component;
        a child process overrides the parent's inherited name with its
        own. When ``None``, an operator-set ``OTEL_SERVICE_NAME`` is
        honored, otherwise it defaults to ``"omnigent"``. Deployment-
        level identity (environment, region) belongs in
        ``OTEL_RESOURCE_ATTRIBUTES``.

    Two modes based on the environment:

    * **OTLP export to an external collector.** When
      ``OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT`` is set, installs a
      ``TracerProvider`` backed by an OTLP ``BatchSpanProcessor``
      (Jaeger, Tempo, Grafana, etc.).

    * **No-op / external provider.** When the endpoint is absent,
      tracing is still enabled so operators who configure their own
      ``TracerProvider`` externally get spans automatically. The
      default OTel no-op provider discards spans silently.

# bounded well under the model's context budget and the provider's API
# limits — Anthropic accepts images up to ~5 MB, PDFs up to ~32 MB / 100
# pages, and ~32 MB per request total. The per-type caps below keep a
# single attachment usable across a multi-turn conversation.
#
# Images are the exception: we accept a much larger upload (screenshots,
# retina captures) and shrink it under the provider's per-image limit at
# upload time via :func:`compress_image_attachment`, so the stored blob —
# and the base64 re-sent every turn — always fits. The compressed result is
# what lands in the file store (see the ``files`` upload route).

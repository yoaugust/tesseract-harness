``build_policy_engine`` — construct a :class:`PolicyEngine` for a
workflow.

Called at the top of ``_run_agent_loop``. Seeds any
``LabelDef.initial`` values that are not already present in
``conversation_labels`` using an
``INSERT ... ON CONFLICT DO NOTHING`` semantic so that two
concurrent workflows on the same conversation (the v2 case
tracked in POLICIES.md Open Q #6) never clobber each other's
view of a label's first value.

Phase 2 scope: zero-policy and declared-policy paths both work;
concrete Policy subclasses land in Phases 3+, and this builder
will start instantiating them as those phases ship.

    Construct the :class:`PolicyEngine` for one workflow.

    When ``spec.guardrails`` is ``None`` (no guardrails
    declared), *default_policies* is empty, and no session
    policies are stored, returns a no-op engine with empty
    policies and labels — the four enforcement sites still
    call through, they just always ALLOW.

    When declared labels have an ``initial`` value and no row
    exists yet in ``conversation_labels``, seeds missing keys via
    :meth:`ConversationStore.set_labels`. The hot cache is built
    from the post-seed snapshot.

    Policy run order: session policies (from the CRUD API)
    first, then agent spec policies, then *default_policies*
    (server-wide admin policies). This lets user-configured
    session policies short-circuit on DENY before agent or
    admin policies run, and gives admin policies the last
    word on ALLOW/ASK decisions.

    For sub-agent conversations, session policies from the
    root (top-level) conversation are inherited and prepended
    before any child-specific session policies. This ensures
    guardrails set on the parent session (e.g. via
    ``sys_add_policy``) also govern spawned sub-agents.
    Structurally identical root and child policies evaluate once
    at the root policy's original position. Same-named policies
    with different handlers or parameters both run, root first,
    so a child cannot shadow or reorder an inherited guardrail.

    :param spec: The parsed agent spec.
    :param conversation_id: The conversation this workflow is
        running on, e.g. ``"conv_abc123"``.
    :param conversation: The already-loaded conversation row for
        ``conversation_id``, when the caller holds a current one — skips
        the builder's own read.

        **Preload contract** (one rule, applied at every preload site):
        a preloaded row may supply only IMMUTABLE identity — its ``id``
        and ``root_conversation_id``. Every mutable field the engine
        depends on (labels, session_state, model_override) is re-derived
        from a fresh read taken here. A row that has since disappeared
        fails closed rather than authorizing from the snapshot. Callers
        that rebuild an engine specifically to observe concurrent writes
        (the native ASK gate's post-lock re-evaluation) pass ``None``.
    :param expected_agent_id: The ``agent_id`` the caller resolved *spec*
        from. ``agent_id`` is mutable (switch-agent) but selects the spec,
        so it must be read before the engine exists and cannot be
        re-derived here. Passing it lets the builder confirm it against
        the fresh row and fail closed on a mismatch, instead of
        authorizing an evaluation under the previous agent's guardrails.
        ``None`` skips the check (callers with no spec/agent coupling).
    :param conversation_store: The store used for label reads
        and writes. Held by the engine for the life of the
        workflow.
    :param connection_override: Fallback ``{"base_url", "api_key"}``
        used by prompt policies whose spec declares no
        ``llm.connection``. Explicit policy / agent connections
        still win.
    :param default_policies: Server-wide policies appended after
        per-agent policies. Sourced from ``RuntimeCaps.default_policies``
        (parsed from the server ``--config`` YAML at startup).
        ``None`` and ``[]`` both mean no server-wide policies.
    :param policy_store: Session-scoped policy store. When
        provided, enabled policies for ``conversation_id`` are
        loaded and inserted between agent and admin policies in
        the evaluation order.
    :param server_llm: Server-level LLM configuration from
        ``RuntimeCaps.llm``. When provided, a
        :class:`~omnigent.policies.types.PolicyLLMClient` is
        constructed and injected into every function policy's
        ``event["llm_client"]``. ``None`` means no server-level
        LLM — function policies see ``None``.
    :param host_connection: Per-request ``{"base_url", "api_key"}``
        dict resolved from the caller's auth token (e.g. via
        :attr:`RuntimeCaps.policy_llm_connection_factory`). When
        provided, takes precedence over any connection derived from
        ``server_llm.connection`` / ``server_llm.profile``, so LLM

    Load cumulative session usage for a conversation **plus all of its

    A cost-ask policy on a parent must see what its sub-agents spent,
    but each conversation persists only its own usage, so this sums the
    conversation and every conversation it transitively spawned (all
    share one ``root_conversation_id``). Read-only; the per-conversation
    write path is server-side ``_accumulate_session_usage`` /
    ``_persist_native_cumulative_usage``, not this function.

    Public because the server's session snapshot / ``session.usage`` SSE
    use this per-node subtree total to DISPLAY a node's own cost (a
    sub-agent's badge shows only its subtree). Cost GATING does NOT use
    this per-node view — it seeds from the whole-tree total via
    :func:`_policy_usage_seed` (which calls this with the tree root), so a
    sub-agent gates against the full session spend rather than just its own
    subtree.

        row, whose root may differ. A supplied root is therefore validated
        against the tree it produces — if this conversation is not in that

        instead. ``None`` resolves it here from the start.

    Load enabled session policies from the store and convert
    them to :class:`FunctionPolicySpec` instances.

    Results are cached per ``(workspace_id, conversation_id)`` with a
    30 s TTL (see :data:`_SESSION_POLICY_SPECS_CACHE`). Mutations call
    :func:`invalidate_session_policy_specs_cache` for immediate local
    eviction on the replica that handled the change; the TTL is the
    safety net for replicas in a horizontally-scaled deployment that
    never received the invalidation signal. Same-replica mutations
    (including ``sys_add_policy``) still take effect on the next engine
    build via the explicit invalidation; cross-replica propagation is
    bounded to ≤ 30 s.

    Only ``type="python"`` policies are instantiable today. An
    enabled policy of an unsupported type (e.g. ``type="url"``)
    raises :class:`OmnigentError` rather than being skipped, so a
    stored guardrail that never enforces fails loudly.

    :returns: List of :class:`FunctionPolicySpec` for enabled
        session policies, in ``created_at ASC`` order.
    :raises OmnigentError: If an enabled policy has an unsupported

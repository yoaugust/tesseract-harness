``PolicyEngine`` — per-workflow owner of policies + label state.

The engine is a plain local constructed at the top of

sites. No ContextVar, no container class (see POLICIES.md §4
for the rationale).

The engine dispatches to registered :class:`Policy` instances
(:class:`FunctionPolicy` and :class:`PromptPolicy`).
The orchestration here handles composition.

class PolicyEngine:
    """
    Owns policies + label state for one workflow execution.

    Constructed once at the top of ``_run_agent_loop`` via
    :func:`build_policy_engine` and passed explicitly to the
    four enforcement sites (§5). Labels are hot-cached on the
    engine for the life of the workflow and written through to
    ``conversation_labels`` via the conversation store on every
    ``apply_label_writes`` call.

    :param policies: Per-workflow :class:`Policy` instances
        in YAML declaration order. The engine iterates this
        list in order on every ``evaluate`` call; DENY
        short-circuits, ASK accumulates, ALLOW continues.
    :param label_defs: Per-key ``LabelDef`` schemas from the
        agent spec. Used by ``apply_label_writes`` to validate
        ``values`` + ``monotonic`` constraints. Empty dict
        when no labels were declared.
    :param ask_timeout: Spec-wide default approval timeout in
        seconds (POLICIES.md §7). Per-policy overrides live on
        :class:`PolicySpec` and are looked up via
        :meth:`spec_for`.
    :param conversation_id: The conversation this engine owns
        label state for.
    :param initial_labels: Labels already persisted for the
        conversation at workflow-start (the hot cache seed).
    :param initial_session_state: Seed state for the hot cache.
        Policies can read the current state via
        ``event["session_state"]`` and request updates via
        :attr:`PolicyResult.state_updates`. State is in-memory only
        for the engine's lifetime; cross-turn persistence is the
        caller's responsibility. Empty dict when no seed is provided.
    :param initial_usage: Cumulative LLM token usage seed, e.g.
        ``{"input_tokens": 500, "output_tokens": 200,
        "total_tokens": 700, "total_cost_usd": 0.012}``. Loaded
        from the conversation's persisted ``session_usage`` at
        engine-build time so counters survive across turns.
        Defaults to all-zeros when no prior usage exists.
    :param token_pricing: Full per-token pricing from the MLflow
        catalog, including cache-read and cache-write rates.
        ``None`` when pricing is unavailable — ``total_cost_usd``
        stays at ``0.0`` in that case.
    :param initial_model: The model the session is currently
        using — the conversation's ``model_override`` when set,
        else the agent spec's ``llm.model``, e.g.
        ``"databricks-claude-opus-4-8"`` or the native tier alias
        ``"opus"``. Resolved at engine-build time and injected
        into every policy dispatch as ``event["context"]["model"]``
        so callables can gate on the active model. ``None`` when
        no override and no spec ``llm`` (model undeterminable).
    :param conversation_store: Write-through target for label
        mutations. Held by reference so every
        ``apply_label_writes`` call goes to the same backing store.
    :param llm_client: A shared
        :class:`~omnigent.policies.types.PolicyLLMClient`
        instance for policy LLM calls. Built from the server-level
        ``llm:`` config at engine build time. ``None`` when the
        server has no ``llm:`` config — function policies that
        need an LLM will see ``None`` in ``event["llm_client"]``.

    - Within a key, a scalar value is an equality check; a
      list is an OR — the stored value must appear in the

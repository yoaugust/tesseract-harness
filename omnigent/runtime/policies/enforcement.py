"""
``_enforce_policy`` — thin call-site wrapper for the engine.

Called from the four enforcement sites (input, tool_call,
tool_result, output) in the workflow. Per POLICIES.md §5, this
helper does NOT apply label writes — the engine handles ALLOW
and DENY paths internally, and :func:`_await_policy_approval`
(Phase 8) applies ASK writes on approval. Wrapping the
evaluate call in a named helper keeps the enforcement-site
branching tight and gives observability a single symbol to
hook on later.

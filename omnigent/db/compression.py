"""Transparent client-side compression for opaque text columns.

A handful of columns hold machine-generated JSON or free text that is never
queried in SQL or read by hand — per-conversation ``session_state`` /
``session_usage``, native ``terminal_launch_args``, comment bodies/anchors, and
agent descriptions. Compressing them on the client gives a uniform on-disk size
across every backend: MySQL's InnoDB does not compress ``TEXT``/``BLOB`` by
default and SQLite never does, so relying on per-backend storage compression
would leave those two uncompressed while PostgreSQL (TOAST) compresses.

Stored layout (bytes), chosen so post-migration and legacy rows coexist without
a backfill:

* **New values are framed:** a leading NUL sentinel (``0x00``) followed by a
  one-byte codec id and the payload. Valid text in these columns can never
  start with NUL — PostgreSQL forbids NUL in ``text`` outright, and the JSON
  they hold always leads with ``{``/``[``/``"`` — so the sentinel is an
  unambiguous "this row is framed" marker.
* **Legacy values are unframed UTF-8 text** (written while the column was
  ``TEXT``). They are detected by the absent sentinel — or, under SQLite's
  dynamic typing, by arriving as ``str`` — and returned unchanged. Each such
  row re-frames itself the next time it is written.

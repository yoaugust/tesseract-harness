"""add workspace column to conversations

Revision ID: b8c4f2e7a9d1
Revises: a7b3c9d1e5f2
Create Date: 2026-05-29 12:00:00.000000

Adds ``conversations.workspace``: the absolute path on disk where
the runner should start (designs/SESSION_WORKSPACE_SELECTION.md).
Required when ``host_id`` is set; optional for CLI-launched sessions
that record their starting cwd for display purposes.

Also adds the ``host_id`` -> ``hosts.host_id`` foreign key
(ON DELETE SET NULL) and the ``ix_conversations_host_id`` index,
folded into this migration's batch rebuild of ``conversations`` so
the column added in a7b3c9d1e5f2 isn't left FK-less and unindexed.

    Add the ``workspace`` column to ``conversations``.

    ``ck_conversations_workspace_required_for_host``); CLI sessions
    may populate it for display but are not required to.

    Batch mode is required for SQLite, which can't ALTER constraints
    in place — alembic copies the table, applies the column + check
    in one shot, and renames it back.

"""add updated_at to comments (per-session change fingerprint)

Revision ID: ecc0e25727b0
Revises: j1a2b3c4d5e6
Create Date: 2026-06-10 00:00:00.000000

Adds an ``updated_at`` column to ``comments`` so each row records when its
body or status last changed, in Unix epoch **microseconds** — microsecond
precision keeps back-to-back mutations within the same second
distinguishable to diff-based consumers while remaining an exact
integer in JavaScript (epoch-µs < ``Number.MAX_SAFE_INTEGER``). The per-session aggregate
(count + max ``updated_at``) is surfaced on ``GET /v1/sessions`` and the
``WS /v1/sessions/updates`` stream as a change fingerprint, letting web
clients refresh their comment list when another user or the agent mutates
comments.

Existing rows are backfilled with ``created_at`` scaled to microseconds
(a never-edited comment's ``updated_at`` is its creation time), after
which the column is tightened to ``NOT NULL`` to match the ORM model.
``BigInteger`` because epoch-µs overflows a 32-bit column on PostgreSQL.

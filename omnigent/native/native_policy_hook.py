"""Shared conversion between native-harness hooks and Omnigent policy events.

Both Claude Code and Codex expose a command-hook system whose
``PreToolUse`` / ``PostToolUse`` payloads use the same field names
(``hook_event_name``, ``tool_name``, ``tool_input``, ``tool_response``)
and whose ``UserPromptSubmit`` payload carries the user prompt under
``prompt``. This module owns the harness-neutral translation between
that hook shape and the server's proto-compatible ``EvaluationRequest``
/ ``EvaluationResponse`` schema served by
``POST /v1/sessions/{id}/policies/evaluate``, so the per-harness hook
entrypoints (:mod:`omnigent.harnesses.claude_native.hook`,
:mod:`omnigent.harnesses.codex_native.hook`) share one implementation.

The output contract differs by hook event: ``PreToolUse`` enforces via
``hookSpecificOutput.permissionDecision``, while ``UserPromptSubmit``
enforces via the top-level ``decision`` / ``reason`` fields (both
harnesses parse ``decision: "block"`` to drop the prompt before the
model sees it).

    Convert an ``EvaluationResponse`` into native-harness hook output JSON.

    For ``PreToolUse`` the policy layer only *enforces* — it emits a
    ``hookSpecificOutput.permissionDecision`` solely for verdicts that
    constrain the tool: ``POLICY_ACTION_DENY`` → ``"deny"`` (with
    ``permissionDecisionReason``). ``POLICY_ACTION_ASK`` is resolved
    server-side now (URL-based elicitation: ``POST /policies/evaluate``
    holds the gate and returns a hard ALLOW/DENY), so the hook should
    never see ASK; if it does, it fails closed with ``"deny"`` rather
    than the old ``"defer"`` — ``defer`` handed control back to the
    harness's ``permission_mode``, which ``acceptEdits`` /
    ``bypassPermissions`` would auto-approve, bypassing the human.
    ``POLICY_ACTION_ALLOW`` — which is the engine's default verdict when
    no policy matches a tool call, not just an explicit author allow —
    returns ``None`` ("no opinion") so the harness's *own* permission
    system still runs. Emitting ``"allow"`` here would auto-approve the
    tool and suppress the harness's native permission prompt (and, for
    Claude Code, the ``PermissionRequest`` hook that routes that prompt
    to the web UI), collapsing two independent gates — the deployment's
    policy gate and the user's own consent gate — into one. The policy
    layer may block (DENY) or demand approval (ASK); it must not silence
    the user's consent. For ``PostToolUse`` a ``DENY`` is surfaced as
    ``additionalContext`` because the tool result is already committed
    — PostToolUse hooks cannot block.

    For ``UserPromptSubmit`` the output uses the top-level ``decision`` /
    ``reason`` contract (not ``permissionDecision``): ``DENY`` → ``{"decision":
    "block", "reason": ...}``, which drops the prompt before the model sees
    it. ASK is resolved server-side (``_hold_native_ask_gate`` collapses it
    to a hard ALLOW/DENY before the response reaches the hook), so the hook
    should never see ASK; if it somehow does, it fails closed by blocking.
    ALLOW (and the engine's no-match default) returns ``None`` so the prompt
    proceeds. Unlike ``PreToolUse``, there is no separate user-consent gate
    on a prompt, so ALLOW need not preserve one.

    Both Claude Code and Codex consume these exact output shapes, so the

    Called by the per-harness hooks when the ``/policies/evaluate``
    round-trip cannot produce a usable verdict for an *already-governed*
    session — the server is unreachable, returns a non-2xx status, or
    returns an empty / malformed body. Without this the hooks emitted "no
    opinion" on those paths, silently letting the gated tool run: for
    native harnesses this hook is the sole enforcement point (it gates
    Bash / Write / Edit / the native Skill tool / connector-native
    ``mcp__*`` tools), so a transient outage disabled all DENY/ASK
    enforcement.

    The default is phase-aware, matching
    :data:`omnigent.policies.types.FAIL_CLOSED_PHASES` (the runner-side
    precedent from PR #163) — but expressed in hook-event terms so the
    lightweight hook subprocess need not import the policy package:

    - ``PreToolUse`` (``PHASE_TOOL_CALL``) fails CLOSED → ``deny``. This is
      the authoritative pre-execution gate; an unevaluable policy must not
      let the call through.
    - ``UserPromptSubmit`` (``PHASE_REQUEST``) fails CLOSED →
      ``{"decision": "block", ...}``. This is the sole pre-turn enforcement
      point for native sessions; a server hiccup must not let an over-budget
      or otherwise-blocked request proceed.
    - ``PostToolUse`` (``PHASE_TOOL_RESULT``) fails OPEN → ``None``. By the

    Build the fail-ask hook output for an unobtainable policy verdict.

    Like :func:`fail_closed_hook_output` but for ``PreToolUse``: instead of
    auto-denying the tool call, returns ``permissionDecision: "ask"`` so the
    harness explicitly prompts the user for approval. This preserves human
    oversight when the policy server is transiently unreachable — the user
    still decides — rather than blocking all tool calls until the server
    recovers. Unlike returning ``None`` (which fails open in
    ``bypassPermissions`` / ``acceptEdits`` modes), ``"ask"`` forces the
    approval dialog regardless of the current permission mode.

    ``UserPromptSubmit`` still blocks (fail-closed) because it is the sole
    pre-turn enforcement gate for native sessions; a server hiccup must not
    let an over-budget or otherwise-blocked request proceed silently.

    Use this for harnesses whose native TUI has an interactive approval UI
    (claude-native, codex-native). For headless harnesses where no approval
    UI is available, prefer :func:`fail_closed_hook_output`.

    POST to the Omnigent policy evaluate endpoint, retrying on transient errors.

    Retries on 5xx HTTP responses and connection-level errors
    (:class:`httpx.ConnectError`, :class:`httpx.ConnectTimeout`) within
    :data:`_EVALUATE_POLICY_RETRY_BUDGET_S`. Returns the successful response,
    or ``None`` if the budget is exhausted or a non-retryable error occurs.

    A 5xx or torn connection that arrives only after the POST was held at
    least :data:`_EVALUATE_POLICY_HELD_POLL_FLOOR_S` is not a fault but a
    gateway severing a parked ASK long-poll (the Databricks front door caps
    any request at 300s and answers 504). It re-POSTs the same id after the
    initial backoff — inside the server's re-park grace, so the approval card
    survives — and spends none of the transient budget, so a slow human is
    never failed closed by the proxy.

    A stable ``_omnigent_elicitation_id`` is minted once and stamped on
    every attempt. When the server parks an ASK gate and the connection
    drops (5xx or :class:`httpx.ConnectError`), the retry re-POSTs the
    same id so the server re-attaches to the existing elicitation rather
    than minting a new one — mirroring the ``_post_hook_with_reattach``
    idiom used by the ``PermissionRequest`` hook. This prevents a
    second approval card from appearing when the first was already
    published before the error.

    4xx responses are final — a bad request won't succeed on retry. A
    :class:`httpx.ReadTimeout` is final too: it fires only after the server
    held the poll for the whole read budget, i.e. the ask itself timed out.
    The caller is responsible for fail-closed handling on ``None``.

    :param url: Absolute URL of the evaluate endpoint.
    :param headers: Auth headers for the Omnigent server.
    :param eval_request: ``EvaluationRequest`` JSON body to POST.
    :param read_timeout: Per-attempt read timeout in seconds. Should be
        large (e.g. one day) to accommodate long-polling ASK gates.
    :param hook_label: Diagnostic label used in stderr messages,
        e.g. ``"evaluate-policy hook"`` or ``"codex evaluate-policy hook"``.
    :param reauth: Optional callable that re-mints fresh auth headers when
        the server bounces the request to its OAuth login flow (the Apps
        front door 302→``/oidc/``) or returns ``401`` — i.e. the one-shot
        ``ap_auth_headers`` token lapsed. Called at most once; returning new
        headers triggers an immediate retry with them, mirroring the runner's
        refresh-capable :class:`~omnigent.runner._entry._RunnerDatabricksAuth`.
        ``None`` (the default) keeps the legacy behavior for callers that have
        no token source. Returning ``None`` from it falls through to the
        normal failure handling (the caller fails closed). A poll the server
        held past the floor re-arms the one-shot, so a wait longer than the
        token lifetime survives every lapse.
    :returns: ``(response, error)`` — on success, ``(response, None)``; on
        failure, ``(None, short_error_string)`` describing the last error so
        callers can surface it in the deny/block reason shown to the user.

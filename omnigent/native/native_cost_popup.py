"""
Interactive cost-budget approval prompt for a native terminal.

Runs *inside* a ``tmux display-popup`` overlaid on a native harness's
TUI pane (claude-native / codex-native). It renders a cost-budget
checkpoint to the user, reads an approve/decline answer, and POSTs the
verdict to the Omnigent server's elicitation-resolve endpoint — the **same**
endpoint the web ``ApprovalCard`` uses, so the two surfaces resolve one
shared elicitation Future (whichever answers first wins; the other
clears).

The process is launched by the runner-side popup helper (e.g.
:func:`omnigent.harnesses.claude_native.bridge.display_cost_approval_popup`) as::

    python -I -m omnigent.native.native_cost_popup \
        --config-file <bridge_dir>/cost_popup.json \
        --session-id conv_abc123 \
        --elicitation-id elicit_deadbeef \
        --message "Session cost $0.12 crossed the $0.10 checkpoint. Continue?"

AP routing (base URL + auth headers) is read from ``--config-file``
rather than argv so the bearer token never lands in the process list /
tmux command line. The runner writes a freshly-minted ``cost_popup.json``
snapshot at popup launch (a stale launch-token snapshot would 401 the
verdict POST); the file carries ``ap_server_url`` + ``ap_auth_headers``.

Dismissing the popup (Escape / Ctrl-C / EOF) exits **without** posting a
verdict, leaving the elicitation outstanding so it can still be answered
in the web UI or resolved by the server-side approval timeout.

        the helpers on a hard failure.

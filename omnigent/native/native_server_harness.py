"""Shared :class:`Executor` base for native-server harnesses.

The runner owns the native server + SSE/WS forwarder; this executor is the
harness-side seam that injects web turns over a
:class:`~omnigent.native.native_server_transport.NativeServerTransport`. It is
deliberately thin and transport-agnostic — the same orchestration drives
both codex-native (WS JSON-RPC) and opencode-native (HTTP + SSE):

- ``run_turn`` resolves the native session id from bridge state (briefly
  polling on first turn while the runner boots the server), builds a
  :class:`NativePrompt` from the latest user message, injects it via the
  transport, and yields ``TurnComplete`` — streaming is the forwarder's
  job, matching codex-native's injection/completion split.
- ``interrupt_session`` and ``enqueue_session_message`` route through the
  transport's ``abort`` / ``send_prompt``.

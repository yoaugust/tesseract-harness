"""
JSON dump of an omnigent conversation — the Omnigent mode port of the
legacy ``--log`` feature (see designs/RUN_OMNIGENT_REPL_PARITY.md).

The legacy non-AP path wrote a session-shaped JSON to
``~/.omnigent/logs/`` at REPL exit (`_write_session_log` /
``_session_log_dict`` in ``omnigent/inner/cli.py``). That format
was tied to the in-memory :class:`Session` machinery — omnigent
has no Session, just conversations + items, so this module emits an
**AP-native** shape instead of translating into the legacy schema:

.. code-block:: json

    {
      "version": 1,
      "written_at": "2026-04-27T18:01:23+00:00",
      "format": "omnigent-conversation",
      "agent_name": "resume_test",
      "conversation": {
        "id": "conv_abc...",
        "title": "...",
        "created_at": 1714248083,
        "labels": {...},
        "items": [
          {"id": "item_...", "type": "message", "role": "user", ...},
          {"id": "item_...", "type": "message", "role": "assistant", ...},
          ...
        ],
        "children": [
          {"id": "conv_child_...", "items": [...], "children": [...]},
          ...
        ]
      }
    }

The grep across the codebase confirmed there are no consumers of
the legacy JSON shape (all references are help text in ``cli.py``
or stale worktree copies), so picking an AP-native shape costs us
no compat — and it's a more honest dump of what's actually
persisted.

Sub-agent / child conversations are walked via the parent's items:
``sys_session_send`` spawn calls are persisted as
``function_call_output`` rows whose ``output`` decodes to a
handle dict with ``kind == "sub_agent"`` and a
``conversation_id`` pointing at the child. Same parser the
Ctrl+O debug overlay uses (``_parse_sub_agent_handle`` in
``omnigent/repl/_repl.py``), so spawn handles are recognized
identically across surfaces. Recursion is bounded by a
``visited`` set; a cycle (a child handle that points back at an
ancestor — shouldn't happen in practice) emits a stub node with
``"cycle": true`` rather than recursing forever.

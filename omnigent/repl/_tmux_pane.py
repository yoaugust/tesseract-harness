"""
Tmux pane integration for the REPL.

When the REPL boots inside a tmux pane (``$TMUX`` set), this module:

1. Marks the pane with custom options so other tooling can identify
   it as an omnigent pane and recover the launch args.
2. Discovers the user's existing prefix-table ``split-window`` /
   ``new-window`` bindings and rewrites each one with an
   ``if-shell -F`` wrapper that:

   - When the focused pane has the ``@omnigent-conv-id`` option set
     (i.e. it's an omnigent pane), runs ``omnigent pane-split``
     to launch the chooser in a new pane.
   - Otherwise, runs the user's exact original command unchanged.

The wrap-not-replace mechanism preserves bit-identical behavior in
non-omnigent panes (the else branch is the user's untouched
command), so the global mutation of the ``prefix`` table is
behaviorally invisible everywhere except inside an omnigent pane.

See ``designs/REPL_TMUX_PANE_SPLIT.md`` for the full design.

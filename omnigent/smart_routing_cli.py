"""CLI-side Smart Routing: arm a session so its harness routes what you type.

``omnigent claude --smart-routing`` and ``omnigent codex --smart-routing`` are
the only CLI entry points. Neither routes anything before the TUI starts: the
CLI creates the session through the standard JSON ``POST /v1/sessions`` with
``cost_control_mode_override="on"`` and no ``smart_routing_message``, then
attaches the native wrapper to it. The harness's own first-message hook picks
the model once the user types. Routing a prompt at create time is the web UI's
job — it is the surface that can show and change the pick before the session
runs.

Because the session is created here rather than bundled by the wrapper, the row
already carries the agent binding, the wrapper's presentation labels, and the
Smart Routing mode the hook's server-side gate reads.

Two rules shape everything here:

* **Preflight is a hard error.** Routing that no source on the server can
  serve means the pick could not be applied — say so and stop. A family
  whose inference is not AI-Gateway-backed is not that case: it downgrades to the server's built-in
  router, and only fails when there is no built-in router either.
* **Arming itself fails open.** Once preflight passes, a create the server
  rejects (or cannot answer) returns a one-line notice and no session, and the
  wrapper launches its own. The launch always happens.

    Fail loud when Smart Routing cannot be applied for *harnesses*.

    router, the built-in one, or both. With neither, nothing can produce a pick.

    Gates 2 and 3 are *source selection*, not availability. A family whose
    inference is not AI-Gateway-backed cannot run a gateway-routed pick, so it

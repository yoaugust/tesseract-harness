    Per-elicitation state used to resolve a prompt that was answered in
    the native terminal rather than the web UI.

    Lives alongside the legacy ``_harness_elicitation_registry`` /
    ``_harness_elicitation_owners`` entries (same ``elicitation_id``);
    those keep backing the web-verdict path and the ownership check
    untouched, while this carries the extra state the terminal-resolved
    fast path needs.

    :param session_id: Conversation id that issued the prompt, e.g.
        ``"conv_abc123"`` (mirrors the ``_harness_elicitation_owners``
        entry; kept here so the correlation helper is self-contained).
    :param tool_name: Gated tool name from the harness hook, e.g.
        ``"Bash"``. ``None`` when the harness supplied none (e.g. a
        Codex elicitation), which disables tool-correlated resolution.
    :param tool_input: Gated tool input the prompt was raised for, e.g.
        ``{"command": "rm -rf x"}``. ``None`` when not supplied.
    :param resolved_elsewhere: Set when a mirrored tool result for the
        SAME gated tool proves the prompt was already answered in the
        native terminal, so the parked hook long-poll returns promptly
        instead of blocking until its timeout. This positive,
        application-level signal is needed because
        ``request.is_disconnected()`` does not fire promptly behind the
        Databricks Apps proxy's idle-connection heartbeats.
    :param request_fingerprint: Digest of the elicitation's request
        params, e.g. a sha256 hex string. Copied onto a verdict
        tombstone written while this waiter may be a zombie, so a
        re-park only adopts the verdict for the SAME logical question
        (harness ids can be reused across distinct requests). ``None``
        when the caller supplied no params to fingerprint.

    Tombstone for a harness elicitation resolved before hook registration.

    ``result`` distinguishes the two producers: a web verdict that
    arrived while no wait was parked (a re-park returns it), vs ``None``
    from ``external_elicitation_resolved`` — the terminal already
    answered, so a re-park fail-asks.

    :param session_id: Omnigent session id that issued the resolution, e.g.
        ``"conv_abc123"``.
    :param created_at: Wall-clock timestamp from ``time.time()``, e.g.
        ``1710000000.0``.
    :param result: Web verdict to hand a re-parking hook, e.g.
        ``ElicitationResult(action="accept")``, or ``None`` for a
        terminal-side resolution.
    :param request_fingerprint: Digest of the request params the verdict
        answered, copied from the parked waiter when the resolve found
        one still registered (or digested from the pending prompt on the
        nothing-parked gap path). A re-park adopts a verdict-carrying
        tombstone only when its own params produce the same digest, so a
        LATER, different question that reuses the same harness id
        (harness request ids recur) can never inherit a stale approval.

"""Tunnel-backed ``ws_factory`` for browser terminal attach.

The server's :mod:`omnigent.server.routes.terminal_attach` route
proxies browser xterm.js WebSocket connections to whichever runner
owns the conversation's tmux session via a
``set_runner_ws_factory(...)``-installed callable. Previously the
runner exposed a separate WebSocket listener that the server dialed
directly. Now the only server↔runner transport is the
runner's outbound WS tunnel, so this module bridges that gap by
multiplexing tunneled WS *channels* onto the same tunnel using the
``ws.open`` / ``ws.frame`` / ``ws.close`` frame kinds.

Wire flow per browser attach:

1. Browser opens ``WS /v1/sessions/{id}/resources/terminals/
   {terminal_id}/attach``.
2. Terminal-attach route resolves the conversation's pinned runner,
   calls the factory with the runner-side path it constructs.
3. The factory returns :class:`_TunneledWSConn`. Entering its async
   context allocates a fresh ``ch_id``, registers a
   :class:`WSChannelState` on the tunnel registry, and sends a
   ``ws.open`` frame down the tunnel naming the runner-side path.
4. The runner's ASGI dispatch invokes its
   ``@app.websocket("/v1/sessions/{id}/resources/terminals/
   {terminal_id}/attach")`` route, which runs the tmux control bridge.
5. The terminal-attach route's existing shuttle pumps frames in
   both directions through ``conn.send()`` / ``conn.recv()``.
6. Either side's close emits a ``ws.close`` frame; the receiver
   surfaces it as a :class:`websockets.exceptions.ConnectionClosed`
   so the shuttle's existing error-translation branch handles it.

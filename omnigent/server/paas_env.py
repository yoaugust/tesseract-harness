"""Derive the server bind host and public base URL from the PaaS environment.

The OSS Docker entrypoint (``deploy/docker/entrypoint.py``) runs as a
side-effecting boot script, so its host / URL derivation can't be unit-tested
in place. These pure helpers hold that logic so it is testable and reusable,
and so the per-platform quirks (Railway's IPv6 bind, each provider's
public-URL variable) live in one documented spot.

    Resolve the address uvicorn should bind, adjusting for PaaS quirks.

    The explicitly configured host (from the YAML config or the ``HOST`` env
    var) wins, else ``default``. Two platform adjustments are then applied:

    - Strip brackets from the IPv6 URL form ``"[::]"`` → ``"::"`` — some
      platforms (e.g. Railway) inject the bracketed form, which a socket bind
      rejects with ``getaddrinfo`` errors.
    - On Railway, coerce the IPv6 wildcard ``"::"`` to the IPv4 wildcard
      ``"0.0.0.0"``. Railway injects ``HOST=[::]`` but its edge proxy reaches
      the app over IPv4, so binding the IPv6 wildcard drops all traffic and
      fails health checks. Gated on Railway so a deliberate ``HOST=::`` on
      other platforms is preserved.

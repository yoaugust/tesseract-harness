"""OAuth 2.0 client-credentials grant (RFC 6749 §4.4).

A single confidential client exchanges its own credentials for a delegated,
path-scoped access token acting as a fixed machine principal — no browser,
no per-user consent, no device flow. This is the grant a headless process
uses when it is its own resource owner rather than acting for a human.

This module owns no route. It builds the ``client_credentials`` branch of
the app's one ``POST /oauth/token``, which
:func:`omnigent.server.routes.device_auth.create_oauth_token_router` owns and
dispatches by ``grant_type``. A second router on that path would be shadowed
silently, since FastAPI resolves first-match-wins.

On success the branch returns ``{access_token, token_type, expires_in,
scope}``. A bad / absent / mismatched client is ``401 invalid_client``; a
principal that fails its admin vetting is ``400 unauthorized_client``; more
requests from one source than the throttle allows is ``429 slow_down``. The
client check runs before anything has authenticated, so the branch carries
the same per-IP sliding-window limiter the device grant's public authorize
endpoint uses.

**Opt-in and default-off**: the machine client's env config *is* the opt-in.
With none configured the handler is never built, and ``client_credentials``
exchanges answer ``unsupported_grant_type`` like any other unhandled grant.
The device grant needs its own ``OMNIGENT_DEVICE_GRANT_ENABLED`` flag because
its endpoints are useful with zero config (a public client); this grant has
nothing to serve without a configured client, so a separate flag would only be
a second way to say the same thing. Built in the cookie-based auth modes
(``oidc`` and ``accounts``) — it needs the HS256 ``cookie_secret`` both configs
expose, which is also the key the minted token is validated against.

The confidential client is a single env-configured registry entry — no
database, no migration:

- ``OMNIGENT_MACHINE_CLIENT_ID`` — the client identifier. An operator-chosen
  label with no charset or length validation and nothing that allocates it;
  all the security rests on the secret below.
- ``OMNIGENT_MACHINE_CLIENT_SECRET_HASH`` — the client secret, stored only as
  its :func:`hash_secret` digest (HMAC-SHA256 keyed by ``cookie_secret``),
  never the raw secret. Must have that digest's shape (64 hex characters) and
  is verified in constant time. Only the digest is configured, so the server
  cannot measure the secret's entropy — generate it with
  ``secrets.token_urlsafe(32)`` or equivalent. The throttle below bounds how
  fast a secret can be guessed *below the limiter's key-table ceiling*: past
  it the limiter fails open, so an attacker who first fills the table from
  disposable source addresses (trivial over IPv6) then guesses unthrottled
  from a fresh one. The secret's entropy, not the throttle, is what makes
  guessing hopeless. One hash is configurable, so rotation is a hard cutover
  on both sides — there is no two-secret grace window.
- ``OMNIGENT_MACHINE_SUB`` — the machine principal the minted token acts as.
- ``OMNIGENT_MACHINE_TOKEN_TTL`` — access-token lifetime in seconds (default
  3600, and capped there: expiry is this model's only revocation, so the TTL
  is what bounds a stolen token). The client re-mints rather than refreshing —
  there is no refresh token and no store-backed per-token revocation (that is
  the store-backed delegated grant's job).

All three of the first group must be set to enable the grant, or all unset to
leave it off; any other combination — a malformed secret hash, an unusable
TTL — is an operator error and refuses to start rather than coming up with a
grant branch that answers every request ``invalid_request``, which reads as a
client bug. That check only runs in the modes this grant is built for: in
header mode ``app.py`` never reaches the config at all, so a misconfigured
machine client there is silently inert rather than a startup failure.

The minted token reuses the delegated JWT shape
(:func:`omnigent.server.routes.device_auth.mint_delegated_token`) with the
``scope`` claim set and no ``grant_id``: the auth layer confines it to the
delegated path allowlist and, seeing no ``grant_id``, skips the
revocation-denylist lookup.

That allowlist is a PATH confinement only. It does NOT limit the token's
privilege within an allowlisted path: the ``is_admin → LEVEL_OWNER`` override
inside /v1/sessions keys off the token's identity, so an admin ``sub`` would
own every tenant's session. The machine ``sub`` must therefore be a distinct,
non-admin principal — vetted at mount and again on every mint, so promoting it
to admin later stops new tokens instead of waiting for a restart.

See ``designs/CLIENT_CREDENTIALS.md`` for the full design + threat model.

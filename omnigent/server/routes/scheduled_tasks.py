"""REST CRUD for scheduled tasks (``/v1/scheduled-tasks``).

A scheduled task is a saved instruction that fires an agent session on a
recurring RRULE schedule. These endpoints let a client create, list, read,
update, and delete tasks; the live :class:`ScheduledTaskScheduler` is kept in
sync on every mutation so a change takes effect without a restart.

Ownership mirrors hosts: tasks are scoped to the calling user (``"local"`` when
auth is disabled). The RRULE is validated on create/update with
:func:`validate_rrule` — an invalid rule (bad syntax, never-fires, fires-once, or
below the minimum-interval floor) is a 400.

        It does NOT re-implement the fire logic and cannot collide with a
        scheduled fire of the same task (both share the in-flight overlap guard).

        Paused tasks ARE runnable here — run-now is an explicit manual override,
        so it does not require the ``active`` state the scheduler enforces.

        Fire-and-forget: like the scheduler, the session create + launch runs in
        the background, so this returns ``202 Accepted`` with the task id rather
        than the finished run. The new run row (status ``running`` / ``failed`` /
        ``skipped``) appears in the task's ``/runs`` history and in the LIST
        endpoint's ``last_run_status`` once recorded. Returns ``409`` when a fire
        for this task is already in flight, and ``503`` when the scheduler
        subsystem is not running (no trigger wired).

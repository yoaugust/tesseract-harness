        context, so a collaborator granted the session gets it.

        Outside it, ``LEVEL_OWNER``, for reads as much as writes. Everything
        past the workspace is the owner's own machine, and the host-scoped
        endpoint that already browses it (``/v1/hosts/{id}/filesystem``,
        behind the workspace picker) is owner-scoped. Anything weaker here
        would make a shared session a way around that check.

        This is the ONLY place the boundary is decided. The runner is handed
        the path and nothing else: it cannot see who is asking, so it does
        not try to — it enforces the sandbox grants, this enforces identity.

        ``ntpath.isabs`` is used deliberately, and on every platform: it is
        true for BOTH a POSIX leading slash (the wire form this API defines)
        and a Windows drive or UNC root. A gate about identity has to fail
        closed on anything that could be absolute *anywhere*, not just on the
        shape the current deployment happens to send — otherwise a
        ``C:\\Users\\...`` path would slip through at the collaborator level
        and be stopped only by the runner rejecting it further down.

        Note this is the AUTHORIZATION predicate, not the wire-format one.
        Deciding how to encode the path for the runner stays
        ``startswith("/")``, because that is a URL question and URLs use ``/``
        on every platform. The two can disagree only for a Windows-style

        ``session_id`` — this preserves the session-scoping invariant (the
        child reads its OWN copy; no cross-session read grant is created).
        Validation is all-or-nothing: an unauthorized source, a missing
        file, or a request past the copy limits copies nothing.

        The request is bounded before any blob is read: the file count and
        the summed ``StoredFile.bytes`` are checked against the copy limits
        during metadata validation, so an over-limit request is rejected
        without buffering a single blob. Within the limits, files are copied
        one at a time (read → create → put) so peak memory is a single blob,
        not the whole batch.

        :param request: The incoming FastAPI request (for auth).
        :param session_id: Destination (child) session/conversation id.

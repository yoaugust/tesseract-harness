        Claude Code ``PermissionRequest`` HTTP hook endpoint.

        Receives Claude Code's PermissionRequest hook payload (tool
        name + input the user would otherwise see a TUI prompt for),
        publishes a ``response.elicitation_request`` SSE event on the
        session stream so the web UI's :file:`ApprovalCard` renders
        inline, and long-polls until the verdict arrives via the
        session ``approval`` event path.

        Response shape follows Claude Code's PermissionRequest hook
        contract: ``hookSpecificOutput.decision.behavior`` is
        ``"allow"`` or ``"deny"``. On timeout the endpoint returns
        ``200`` with an empty body — Claude Code treats that as
        "defer to the TUI prompt", which matches the wrapper's
        fail-ask contract (UI unreachable / unattended → fall back
        to terminal-side approval).

        Auth: standard session ACL — the wrapper's outbound headers
        (``ap_auth_headers`` in :func:`build_hook_settings`) carry
        the same Bearer token used for every other Omnigent request. For
        local-server mode (no auth provider), unauth'd calls are

    # ── Proto event-type → validation schema, as ONE total mapping ────
    #
    # This used to be three independent structures: which wire types are
    # accepted, which phases require an object payload, and which phases
    # need a tool name and where it may come from. The docstring on each
    # said "one schema per phase" while the code let you add a wire type to
    # the first table alone — the new phase was then accepted, validated as
    # permissively as possible (``dict | str``), and got no tool-name rule
    # at all, because the other two tables simply had no entry for it and
    # every lookup against them used a permissive default (``in a
    # frozenset`` / ``.get(phase, ())``).
    #
    # A NamedTuple with no defaults on either field makes that impossible:
    # you cannot add a wire type without also deciding, right there, both
    # whether its payload must be an object and where its tool name (if any)
    # comes from. There is deliberately no fallback path for a phase this
    # dict doesn't recognize — the "Unknown event type" branch below is the
    # only way to reach past it, and it 400s rather than silently allowing.
    #
    # ``data`` shape: tool and LLM phases carry a structured payload, so a
    # string there is a malformed call. REQUEST carries prompt text and is
    # the only phase where a bare string is a legitimate wire form.
    #
    # Tool name containers are listed in precedence order because two
    # first-party producers spell it differently: claude-native and the
    # in-process tool dispatch send ``request_data.name``, while the OpenCode
    # plugin sends the tool in ``event.target``. Both are established wire
    # shapes; requiring one spelling 400s the other, and that producer treats
    # any non-2xx as ALLOW — so a stricter guard silently disabled its
    # policies instead of tightening them.

        loopback endpoint, advertised as ``turn_router.json``) because

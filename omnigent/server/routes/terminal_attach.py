"""WebSocket endpoint exposing an agent's live terminals to the browser.

This module hosts the resource-addressed terminal-attach route:

- ``WS /sessions/{session_id}/resources/terminals/{terminal_id}/attach``
  - open a bidirectional bridge between a browser xterm.js client
  and the runner-side tmux session named by ``terminal_id``.

Runner-aware execution
----------------------

Terminal state lives in whichever process owns the
:class:`TerminalRegistry` that ``sys_terminal_launch`` mutated:

- **In-process runner**: the server passes
  :func:`omnigent.runtime.get_terminal_registry` into
  :func:`omnigent.runner.create_runner_app`, so the registry is
  shared. The server resolves the terminal id locally and bridges
  tmux control mode in-process.
- **Out-of-process runner** over the WebSocket tunnel: the runner
  owns the tmux socket. The server proxies WebSocket frames over
  the tunnel via a multiplexed WS channel
  (``omnigent/server/_runner_ws_tunnel.py``), and the runner's
  resource-addressed WS route bridges tmux control mode.

The proxy uses a factory configured via
:func:`omnigent.runtime.set_runner_ws_factory` in the server
lifespan. When the factory is unset, the server route falls back
to resolving the terminal in the local registry.

Wire protocol on the WebSocket
------------------------------

- **Server → client**: terminal output is forwarded as *binary* WebSocket
  frames. xterm.js's ``term.write()`` accepts ``Uint8Array`` directly and runs
  it through its ANSI parser, so colors, cursor motion, alternate screen, and
  mouse modes work transparently. A text ``clipboard-write`` JSON frame may
  follow a tmux copy-mode selection.
- **Client → server**:
    - **Text frames** are JSON control messages such as
      ``{"type": "resize", "cols": N, "rows": M}``. Unknown shapes are
      ignored for forward compatibility.
    - **Binary frames** are raw input bytes forwarded to tmux. xterm.js's
      ``onData`` callback emits these for keystrokes, pasted text, and mouse
      reports.

Read-only mode
--------------

When the URL has ``?read_only=true``, binary input frames are dropped
silently at the server *and* the runner. The tmux control-mode client is also
marked read-only so tmux refuses input from this attachment.

Write attach is owner-only
--------------------------

A terminal is a single shared PTY driving one process that runs as the
session owner. Raw keystroke bytes carry no per-user identity, so input
typed by anyone other than the owner would be acted on — and, for the
agent's TUI, persisted into conversation history — as if the owner typed
it. To keep that attribution honest, an *interactive* (write) attach
requires ``LEVEL_OWNER``; non-owners can only attach read-only and drive
the agent through the chat composer, which carries the real sender's
identity. This holds uniformly for the agent's own terminal and for
user-launched shells, since both attach through this route.

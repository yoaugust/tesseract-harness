"""Ownership-checked resolution for host runner launches.

Two routes spawn a runner subprocess on a user's host machine and
bind it to a session: ``POST /v1/sessions`` (inline host launch) and
``POST /v1/hosts/{host_id}/runners``. A runner executes arbitrary
tools (shell, file I/O) on the host as that host's user, so a launch
must be authorized against BOTH the host and the session:

- the caller must own the target host (else they could run code on
  another user's machine — cross-user RCE), and
- the caller must own the target session (else they could bind their
  runner to another user's session, or another user's host to their
  session — cross-user hijack / data theft).

Centralizing the checks here keeps the two call sites from drifting
(the original bug was each site enforcing a different subset).

    Every route that reaches a host over its live tunnel looks it up in the
    local (this-replica) ``HostRegistry``. When replicas are sharded by host, a
    request keyed to ``host_id`` can land on a replica that doesn't hold the
    tunnel — the same wrong-replica case ``RunnerRouter`` handles for runner
    dispatch. Tell the two apart from the host record the caller already loaded:

    - **sharded** deployment and still **live** (online + fresh heartbeat) → up
      on some replica, just not here → :data:`~ErrorCode.WRONG_REPLICA` (400) so
      the client re-addresses WITHOUT the key.
    - otherwise → genuinely unreachable here → ``CONFLICT`` (409).

    On a single-replica deployment the local registry is authoritative: an
    absent host is unreachable, full stop. Claiming ``WRONG_REPLICA`` there is a
    lie the client can't satisfy — there is no other replica to re-address to,
    so a stale-but-``online`` DB row (a host that went away without a clean
    ``set_offline`` — version swap, crash) would drive an endless 400 poll loop.
    So ``WRONG_REPLICA`` is emitted only when the deployment is actually sharded.

    :param host: The host's persistent record (owner-checked by the caller).
    :param sharded: Whether this deployment shards by host_id. Defaults to
        auto-detection (:func:`_deployment_is_sharded`); overridable for tests.

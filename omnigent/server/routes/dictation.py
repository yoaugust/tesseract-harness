"""Streaming dictation route: the transcription WebSocket.

This module hosts the server-side speech-to-text surface behind the
composer mic button (``designs/server-dictation.md``):

- ``WS /v1/dictation/stream`` — one connection per dictation take.

Availability is advertised as ``dictation_available`` on ``GET /v1/info``
(the web UI's boot-time capability probe); there is no separate probe
endpoint.

Wire protocol on the WebSocket
------------------------------

- **Client → server, binary frames**: raw 16 kHz mono s16le PCM. The
  browser worklet downsamples from the capture rate before sending.
- **Client → server, text frames**: JSON control messages.
  ``{"type": "stop"}`` asks the server to flush trailing audio and
  finish the take. Unknown shapes are ignored so future control
  messages don't break older servers.
- **Server → client, text frames**: JSON events.
    - ``{"type": "ready"}`` — sent once after the engine is ready;
      the client may start streaming audio.
    - ``{"type": "partial", "text": ...}`` — revisable in-progress
      utterance, throttled server-side.
    - ``{"type": "final", "text": ...}`` — an utterance completed by
      endpoint detection (a pause). The client appends it and clears
      its partial region.
    - ``{"type": "stopped", "text": ...}`` — reply to ``stop``: the
      flushed tail utterance (possibly empty). The server closes the
      socket after sending it.
    - ``{"type": "error", "message": ...}`` — fatal; the server closes.

Auth
----

Dictation is not session-scoped — the new-chat composer dictates before
any session exists — so the check is identity-level only, matching
``GET /v1/harnesses``: when an auth provider is configured the caller
must be authenticated (the WebSocket handshake carries identity via the
ingress/dev proxy exactly like the terminal-attach socket); in
single-user/dev mode the route is open.

Capacity
--------

Decoding is CPU-bound, so concurrent takes are capped (default 2,
``OMNIGENT_DICTATION_MAX_STREAMS``). Over-cap connections are accepted
and immediately closed with code 1013 (try again later) so the client
can distinguish "busy" from "broken".

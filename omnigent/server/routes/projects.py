"""REST API routes for projects (``/v1/projects``).

Projects are first-class, owner-private containers that group sessions (see
``designs/PROJECTS_PRD.md``). These endpoints let the web UI create empty
projects, list them, rename them, and delete them. Session membership
(filing a session into a project) is managed on the sessions API via the
conversation store's ``project_id``.

Because projects are owner-private and carry no ACL of their own, every handler
scopes to the requesting user: a caller only ever sees and mutates their own
projects. In single-user mode (no auth provider) the owner is ``None`` and all
projects share that scope.

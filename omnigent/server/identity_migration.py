"""Provider-agnostic identity remap for the accounts → OIDC switch.

When a deployment moves from the ``accounts`` provider to ``oidc``, the
identity *key* changes: accounts keys a user by their chosen username
(``"alice"``, ``getpass.getuser()`` → ``"dhruv.gupta"``), while OIDC
keys them by the IdP-returned email (``"alice@example.com"``). Every
row that references a user id — permission grants, conversation
ownership-by-grant, comments, policies, invite/magic tokens, host
ownership — is keyed on the *old* string. A naive provider switch would
make the same human a brand-new principal: not admin, and unable to see
any of their own sessions.

This module rewrites those identity strings in one transaction so the
team keeps its admin and its data across the switch. It operates purely
on the relational tables (it does not import the accounts or OIDC
providers), so it works regardless of which provider originally wrote
the rows, and the same code migrates a Postgres or a SQLite deployment.

User-id-bearing columns rewritten (the full set as of this schema):

- ``users.id`` (the principal row — PK)
- ``session_permissions.user_id`` (FK → users.id; PK part)
- ``account_tokens.user_id`` and ``account_tokens.created_by``
- ``comments.created_by``
- ``policies.created_by``
- ``hosts.user_id`` (unique-constraint part)

Ordering within a mapping is load-bearing: the new ``users`` row is
created first (so FK-bearing children can point at it), children are
repointed next, and the old ``users`` row is deleted last (so the
``ON DELETE CASCADE`` on ``session_permissions`` never fires against
grants we still need).

"""Server-launched sandbox hosts for ``host_type="managed"`` sessions.

The external host flow has a human run ``omnigent host`` on their own
machine. The managed flow replaces the human: when a session is created
with ``host_type="managed"``, the server provisions a cloud sandbox,
starts ``omnigent host`` inside it, and waits for that host to
register — after which the session rides the exact same host-launch
machinery an external host uses (binding token, ``host.launch_runner``
frame, runner tunnel).

The host's identity is DURABLE while its sandbox is not: the ``hosts``
row carries the managed columns (launch-token digest + expiry,
provider, sandbox id), and a relaunch overwrites them in place — a new
sandbox generation under the same ``host_id``, so session bindings
survive a sandbox dying at the provider's lifetime cap.

The sandbox host authenticates back with a dedicated launch token the
server mints per launch (see
:meth:`omnigent.stores.host_store.HostStore.register_managed_host`,
:meth:`omnigent.stores.host_store.HostStore.replace_managed_host_sandbox`, and
the managed-token branch in
:mod:`omnigent.server.routes.host_tunnel`) — the user's own
credentials never enter the sandbox.

How a deployment supplies the sandbox backend (two paths, one seam —
:class:`ManagedSandboxConfig` carries a launcher FACTORY, so embedding
deployments inject custom launchers the same way they inject custom
stores into ``create_app``):

1. **Server YAML** (OSS / self-hosted): :func:`parse_sandbox_config`
   builds the config from the ``sandbox:`` section
   (``omnigent server -c`` / ``OMNIGENT_CONFIG`` /
   ``<data_dir>/config.yaml``)::

       sandbox:

   Most providers default to a public prebaked host image, so
   ``provider`` + ``server_url`` is a complete config. Gensee instead starts a
   provider-managed runtime. Registry-backed
   providers use ``ghcr.io/omnigent-ai/omnigent-host:latest`` (see
   :data:`omnigent.onboarding.sandboxes.base.DEFAULT_HOST_IMAGE`); Blaxel uses
   ``blaxel/omnigent-host:latest``, which adds its required ``sandbox-api``.
   Both defaults remain overridable. Use a private immutable Blaxel image when
   a production rollout must stay on fixed image contents.
   Provider credentials are NOT in this file
   (12-factor): the Modal launcher reads ``MODAL_TOKEN_ID`` /
   ``MODAL_TOKEN_SECRET`` (or ``~/.modal.toml``) and the Daytona
   launcher reads ``DAYTONA_API_KEY`` (plus optional
   ``DAYTONA_API_URL`` / ``DAYTONA_TARGET``), and the Islo launcher
   reads ``ISLO_API_KEY`` (plus optional ``ISLO_BASE_URL``) from the
   server process environment. Gensee reads the environment variable named by
   ``sandbox.gensee.api_token_env`` (``GENSEE_CONTROLLER_API_TOKEN`` by
   default). The Blaxel launcher reads ``BL_WORKSPACE``
   and ``BL_API_KEY`` or the local ``bl login`` profile. The OpenShell
   launcher needs no API key:
   it connects to the gateway made active with ``openshell gateway
   select`` (``$OPENSHELL_GATEWAY`` / ``~/.config/openshell/active_gateway``,
   or ``sandbox.openshell.cluster``), so the server process needs
   OpenShell gateway access. The microsandbox launcher needs no
   credentials at all: VMs run embedded on the server host itself
   (Apple Silicon macOS / KVM Linux). Every provider except
   ``lakebox`` has managed-launch support; ``lakebox`` parses but
   rejects at launch.

2. **Direct construction** (embedding deployments): build
   :class:`ManagedSandboxConfig` with a custom
   :class:`~omnigent.onboarding.sandboxes.base.SandboxLauncher`
   factory and pass it to ``create_app(sandbox_config=…)``::

       ManagedSandboxConfig(
           server_url=public_url,
           launcher_factory=lambda: MySandboxLauncher(...),
           token_ttl_s=7 * 24 * 3600,
       )

   A managed-only launcher implements ``prepare`` / ``provision`` /
   ``run`` / ``terminate``; the CLI-bootstrap primitives default to
   capability errors and need no overrides.

    That is only trustworthy for a genuine BUILT-IN (operator-seeded) agent:

    Everything the managed-host flow needs from a deployment.

    Built by :func:`parse_sandbox_config` from the server YAML, or
    constructed directly by embedding deployments to inject a custom
    launcher (see the module docstring).

    :param server_url: Public URL of THIS server that the sandboxed
        host dials back to, e.g. ``"https://omnigent.example.com"``
        (no trailing slash). Explicit — the server cannot reliably
        infer its own public URL behind proxies.
    :param launcher_factory: Zero-argument factory producing the
        :class:`~omnigent.onboarding.sandboxes.base.SandboxLauncher`
        each launch uses, e.g.
        ``lambda: ModalSandboxLauncher(image=…)``. Called per launch
        (launchers may cache provider handles internally). May raise
        ``HTTPException`` to report an unusable backend — the YAML
        path uses this for providers without managed support.
    :param token_ttl_s: Launch-token lifetime in seconds, e.g.
        ``90000`` (25h) for Modal. Must comfortably exceed the
        provider's maximum sandbox lifetime so a live sandbox can
        always re-authenticate its tunnel across reconnects.
    :param managed_launch_supported: Whether ``launcher_factory`` can
        actually serve a managed launch. The YAML path sets this from
        :data:`PROVIDERS_WITH_MANAGED_LAUNCH` — staged providers
        (``lakebox``) parse but get ``False``, since their factory
        rejects at launch. Defaults to ``True`` for
        directly-constructed configs (an embedding deployment's
        custom factory IS the support). Drives the unauthenticated
        ``managed_sandboxes_enabled`` capability flag on
        ``GET /v1/info``, which gates the web UI's sandbox option.
    :param provider: Short provider name surfaced to the web UI so the
        new-session sandbox option can be labeled per provider (e.g.
        ``"modal"`` → "Modal Sandbox", ``"lakebox"`` → "Databricks
        Sandbox"). The YAML path sets it from the parsed
        ``sandbox.provider``. ``None`` for directly-constructed
        embedding configs that don't name a provider — the UI then
        falls back to the generic "New Sandbox" label. Exposed (when
        managed launch is supported) on the unauthenticated
        ``GET /v1/info`` as ``sandbox_provider``.
    :param host_config: Verbatim in-sandbox ``~/.omnigent/config.yaml``
        content (e.g. a ``providers:`` block routing a harness through
        a self-hosted gateway) installed into the sandbox's config before
        ``omnigent host`` starts, or ``None``. Server-managed: previously
        injected entries are replaced or removed on each launch/resume so
        the sandbox always reflects the current block. Provider-agnostic:
        forwarded to every launcher's ``start_host`` — see
        :func:`omnigent.onboarding.sandboxes.base.render_host_config_write_command`.

    Single-flight and idempotent: concurrent callers serialize on a per-host
    lock and re-check liveness under it, so only the first wakes the host.

        exactly like a fresh launch (:func:`_register_and_start_host`) — without it a

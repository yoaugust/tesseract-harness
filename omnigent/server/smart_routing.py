    Calls an external routing service (the Databricks AI-Gateway ``task_v1``

    instead of running a local judge. The candidate models come from

    resolving a pick: it returns both the servable ``model`` and the router's

            explicit ``api_key``). ``None`` for an unauthenticated endpoint or
            when *databricks_profile* supplies per-call OAuth instead.
        :param databricks_profile: Optional Databricks CLI profile. When set
            (and *auth* is ``None``), a fresh bearer is minted per :meth:`route`
            call via the databricks-sdk ``Config`` — which refreshes OAuth
            tokens transparently, so a long-lived server never sends a stale
            token (the 401 an at-startup captured token hits after ~1h).
        :param auth_provider: Optional callable returning the request headers to
            authenticate ONE :meth:`route` call, e.g.
            ``{"Authorization": "Bearer ..."}``. Evaluated per call and takes
            precedence over every other mode, so one process serving many
            workspaces can carry the calling identity instead of a
            construction-time credential. Returning ``None`` (or an empty
            mapping) means this caller has no credential and the request goes
            out unauthenticated — the provider is the sole authority once set,
            never a first attempt that falls back to *auth*.
        :param model_prefixes: Prefixes this deployment's catalog attaches to
            model ids the router keys bare, stripped on the way out and
            restored on its answer. ``None`` uses :data:`MODEL_ID_PREFIXES`.
        :param request_timeout: Per-call timeout in seconds, defaulting to
            :data:`ROUTING_REQUEST_TIMEOUT_S`. The innermost wait in every
            routing ladder, so a slow router degrades to "not routed" long
            before the hook holding the user's prompt or spawn is killed.
        :param selection_model: Model the router should use for its own
            extraction call, sent as ``route_selector.config.model`` so a
            deployment can pin one it has query access to. ``None`` omits
            ``config`` entirely and leaves the router's frozen default.

    (defaulting to *session_id*) and *runner_client* are provided. Only harnesses
    in :data:`_AUTO_ROUTING_HARNESSES` are offered as candidates.

    :param user_message: The user's first message text, used to size the task.
    :param session_id: Session being routed (optional).
    :param catalog_session_id: Session whose catalog defines the candidate set.
        For a sub-agent this should be the PARENT session id — the parent's
        catalog enumerates the spawnable workers (claude_code/codex/pi) with
        their full model lists, whereas the child's own leaf catalog only has a
        ``"self"`` row and would force the static fallback. Defaults to
        *session_id* when unset.
    :param runner_client: HTTP client pointed at the runner (optional).
    :param allowed_family: Restrict candidates to this harness family
        (:func:`omnigent.runner.subagent_routing.harness_family`), e.g.
        ``"gpt"`` for a child of a codex session. ``None`` offers every
        auto-routing harness — only sessions in auto-harness mode.
    :param harness_candidates: Replace the default SDK candidate set with an
        explicit one, e.g. :data:`AUTO_NATIVE_ROUTING_HARNESSES` for a session
        that must land on a native terminal. Callers narrow it to what the host
        can actually run; an empty sequence yields the standard "no routable
        harnesses" error. ``None`` uses :data:`_AUTO_ROUTING_HARNESSES`.
    :param catalog: Harness → model ids resolved without a runner, e.g. the
        host's pre-launch model options during a session create. Used when no
        live runner catalog is in reach; the static table then only tops up the
        candidates it could not answer for.
    :param gateway_backed: Whether every candidate harness resolves
        AI-Gateway-backed inference on the target host. ``False`` takes the
        external router out of play (its picks are gateway catalog ids the pane
        cannot reach) and the built-in judge answers instead.
    :param allow_static_fallback: Whether the static :func:`infer_models` table
        may supply or top up candidates. Callers pass ``gateway_backed``: that
        table is all ``databricks-*`` ids, so off the gateway it would offer
        models the pane cannot run. ``False`` declines instead.
    :returns: ``(harness, model, verdict, error)`` — on success ``error`` is
        ``None``; on failure ``harness``, ``model``, and ``verdict`` are ``None``
        and ``error`` carries a human-readable reason shown in the UI.

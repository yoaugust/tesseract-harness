"""Persistence for the ``accounts`` auth provider.

Sibling to :class:`omnigent.stores.permission_store.PermissionStore`
— same database, separate API surface. Lives here (not under
``stores/``) because it's a server-only concept: only the accounts
provider's routes and bootstrap touch it, never the runtime or the
runner. Internal hosted deploys that run header/OIDC don't
instantiate this store at all, so the new code path is invisible
to them.

The split is deliberate. PermissionStore is a stable contract that
many subsystems depend on (permission checks, session lookups,
admin-flag gating) and polluting it with accounts-specific methods
muddles that boundary. Accounts mode owns its own persistence
surface; PermissionStore stays exactly as it is on ``main``.

Schema:

- Reads / writes three columns on the existing ``users`` table —
  ``password_hash``, ``created_at``, ``last_login_at`` — added by
  the ``g1a2b3c4d5e6`` migration. Those columns are nullable, so
  rows created in header/OIDC mode (where ``PermissionStore.ensure_user``
  is the writer) leave them unset and accounts-specific reads
  return ``None``.
- Owns the ``account_tokens`` table outright — invite + magic-login
  tokens, atomic single-use via ``UPDATE … WHERE redeemed_at IS NULL``.

    # callback we atomically redeem it AND stamp the redeeming email
    # into ``user_id``. That stamped, redeemed row IS the durable
    # pre-authorization — ``is_email_invited`` just looks for one. This
    # keeps the OSS-only invite feature from adding a table that would
    # ship (empty, unused) into the hosted / Databricks-Apps schema.

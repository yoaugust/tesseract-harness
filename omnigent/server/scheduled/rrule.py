"""RRULE (RFC 5545) next-fire computation and interval validator.

A thin wrapper over :mod:`dateutil.rrule` for the scheduled-task scheduler.
A trigger is an RFC 5545 recurrence rule string — e.g. ``"FREQ=HOURLY"`` or
``"FREQ=WEEKLY;BYDAY=MO,TU,WE,TH,FR;BYHOUR=9;BYMINUTE=0"`` — evaluated in a
caller-supplied IANA timezone so a preset such as "Daily at 9:00 AM" fires at
09:00 local wall-clock.

The rule is anchored at midnight of the reference day (localized to the task
timezone), so occurrence phase is deterministic: an hourly rule fires on the
hour, a daily rule at its ``BYHOUR``/``BYMINUTE``. :func:`validate_rrule`
additionally enforces a minimum interval (:data:`MIN_INTERVAL_SECONDS`) and
rejects rules that never fire or fire only once within the search window — each
fire spawns a real agent session, so a runaway cadence is expensive.

    — is deferred to future work if unbounded-interval rules become user-facing.

"""The scheduled-task fire path — the real ``on_fire`` the scheduler invokes.

When :class:`~omnigent.server.scheduled.scheduler.ScheduledTaskScheduler` decides
a task is due it calls ``on_fire(workspace_id, scheduled_task_id)``. This module
supplies the real callback (the scheduler ships only a no-op placeholder). A
firing:

#. **Re-reads the row.** The armed timer is never trusted: the row is re-read by
   id, and a row that vanished (deleted between arming and firing) or is no
   longer ``active`` (paused/deleted) is a logged no-op.
#. **Resolves and validates the launch target.** A task that pinned no
   ``host_id`` resolves the owner's most-recently-active live host at fire time;
   a task that pinned no ``workspace`` (research / summaries / chat-only) starts
   the runner in the host's home directory. A pinned host that is missing or
   offline — and an owner with no live host at all — records a failed/skipped
   run instead of a running run.
#. **Creates a session** bound to the task's agent, carrying the resolved
   ``workspace`` / ``host_id`` and the stored ``model_override`` /
   ``reasoning_effort``.
#. **Grants ownership.** The spawned session gets a ``LEVEL_OWNER`` grant for the
   task's ``user_id`` — or :data:`RESERVED_USER_LOCAL` when it is NULL
   (single-user / OSS). Without the grant the run is invisible.
#. **Launches the runner and dispatches the prompt** so the agent actually runs
   (a seeded prompt with no launched runner would just sit as history).
#. **Records the run** — stamps ``last_run_at`` + ``last_run_conversation_id`` on
   the task row and writes a ``scheduled_task_runs`` history row.

**Fire-and-forget.** The re-read + state guard run synchronously so an obviously
dead fire costs nothing, but the session creation / launch is dispatched onto a
background :func:`asyncio.create_task` and ``on_fire`` returns immediately. If it
blocked on full session startup the scheduler could not re-arm the task's timer
for the fire's duration. A strong reference to each in-flight task is held until
it completes (``loop.create_task`` only keeps a weak one). Any failure in the
background work is caught and logged: a failed fire must never crash the
scheduler, and the current retry policy is simply "the next occurrence fires
normally".

**Execution target.** Scheduled tasks currently support connected-host,
existing-workspace runs only. Future execution modes include managed sandbox,
branch selection, replay/backfill, completion tracking, and multi-replica
leasing through shared session-create orchestration rather than this direct
fire path.

"""Non-interactive credential-write core for UI-driven harness auth.

The web UI's "Add a credential" flow (Setup From the UI, M3) needs to write a
provider credential onto a connected host without the interactive
``omnigent setup`` wizard. This module is the shared, prompt-free core the host
daemon's ``host.store_secret`` handler calls — and which the CLI wizard can
call too — mirroring how M1 extracted :func:`try_install_harness_cli` as the
non-interactive install core.

It does exactly what the wizard's "add a key / gateway" path does, minus the
prompts: store the secret (OS keychain, else ``~/.omnigent/secrets.json``),
write a ``providers:`` entry referencing it by ``keychain:<name>`` (never the
raw key), and — for the first provider on a family — make it the default. The
raw secret never lands in ``config.yaml``; it lives only in the secret store.

Scope is deliberately narrow (the v1 UI-auth surface): the ``anthropic`` /
``openai`` families served by ``key`` and ``gateway`` providers, which back the
Claude / Codex / Pi harnesses. Subscription / bedrock / databricks kinds are
out of scope here — they are either CLI-login-bound or configured elsewhere.

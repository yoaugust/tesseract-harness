"""Surgical removal of harness wiring written by ``ucode configure``.

Adding a ``kind: databricks`` provider runs ``ucode configure`` (see
:mod:`omnigent.onboarding.ucode_setup`), which wires the Claude / Codex
CLIs to a workspace's Unity AI Gateway. Most of that wiring lives in
ucode-owned sidecar files, but two pieces land in files the *user* owns:

- **Codex < 0.134.0 (ucode's legacy layout):** ucode deep-merges into the
  real ``~/.codex/config.toml`` — a top-level ``profile = "ucode"`` plus
  ``[profiles.ucode]`` and ``[model_providers.ucode-databricks]`` tables —
  which makes every *bare* ``codex`` run (and Omnigent' inner codex, which
  inherits the shared config) route through the workspace gateway.
  ``ucode revert`` does not restore this file (it only restores the
  per-profile ``~/.codex/ucode.config.toml``), so the edit outlives both
  ``ucode revert`` and deleting ``~/.ucode/``.
- **Claude:** a ``web_search`` MCP server is registered into the user-scope
  ``~/.claude.json`` via ``claude mcp add-json``.

Removing the provider entry from ``~/.omnigent/config.yaml`` alone leaves
all of that in place. The helpers here strip exactly the ucode-managed keys
and files — identified by ucode's fixed names (the ``ucode`` profile, the
``ucode-databricks`` model provider, the ``UCODE_WEB_SEARCH_MODEL`` env
marker) — and leave everything user-owned untouched. Surgical key removal
is deliberately used instead of restoring ucode's backup file: ucode keeps
only the *first-ever* backup, so a whole-file restore would clobber any
config edits the user made since first configuring.

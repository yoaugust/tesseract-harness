"""Microsandbox sandbox launcher (local libkrun microVMs).

Implements :class:`~omnigent.onboarding.sandboxes.base.SandboxLauncher` for
`microsandbox <https://github.com/superradcompany/microsandbox>`_ - an
embedded microVM runtime that boots OCI images directly as hardware-isolated
VMs (libkrun; Apple Silicon macOS / KVM Linux). This module ships in the OSS
build; the microsandbox SDK itself is an optional dependency
(``pip install 'omnigent[microsandbox]'``) imported lazily, so the provider
can be listed and the module probed without it.

Platform traits that shape this launcher:

- **Embedded, no daemon.** The SDK bundles the runtime; sandboxes are spawned
  as host-side child processes and persist state under ``~/.microsandbox``.
  Sandboxes are created ``detached`` so they survive the launching CLI/server
  process; any later launcher instance reconnects by name.
- **Names are the id.** Microsandbox has no separate object id - the unique
  sandbox NAME is the canonical reference. ``provision`` appends a random
  suffix so repeated creates under the same label never collide.
- **Fast stop/restart lifecycle.** A stopped sandbox keeps its writable layer
  and restarts in place in well under a second, so ``can_resume`` is ``True``
  and idle sandboxes are drained (``idle_timeout``) instead of killed.
- **Guest-to-host networking.** The guest reaches the machine running the
  server at ``host.microsandbox.internal``. Host access is deny-by-default
  and scoped to configured TCP ports; the CLI derives a local server's port
  from ``--server``. ``forward_local_port`` does NOT ride this path: it pipes
  host connections inward over the SDK's exec channel.

Concurrency model: the SDK is async-only; omnigent calls launcher methods
synchronously (the server marshals them off its event loop via
``asyncio.to_thread``). Mirroring the boxlite launcher, every SDK call is
marshalled onto a single PROCESS-LIFETIME background loop thread
(:func:`_run`) - one daemon thread for all launcher instances.

"""
Daytona sandbox launcher.

Implements the managed-launch subset of
:class:`~omnigent.onboarding.sandboxes.base.SandboxLauncher` for
`Daytona <https://www.daytona.io>`_ sandboxes. This module ships in the
OSS build; the Daytona SDK itself is an optional dependency
(``pip install 'omnigent[daytona]'``) imported lazily, so the provider
can be listed and the module probed without it.

Supports both server-managed hosts (``host_type="managed"`` sessions —
``prepare`` / ``provision`` / ``run`` / ``terminate``) and the CLI
bootstrap flow (``omnigent sandbox create`` / ``connect`` — file
shipping via the SDK's filesystem API, foreground attach via a PTY
session). The one unimplemented primitive is ``stream_exec``: its only
consumer is the in-sandbox App OAuth login, which requires
local-to-sandbox port forwarding that Daytona doesn't have — the flow
fails fast on :attr:`SandboxLauncher.supports_local_port_forward`
before ``stream_exec`` would ever run.

Platform notes that shape this launcher:

- **No hard lifetime cap, but idle auto-stop.** Daytona stops sandboxes
  after 15 idle minutes BY DEFAULT — fatal for a session host that may
  sit between turns — so :meth:`DaytonaSandboxLauncher.provision`
  disables auto-stop. Sandboxes then live until the session is deleted
  (or the dead-sandbox relaunch path replaces a crashed one).
- **Workload env rides sandbox creation.** Daytona has no named-secret
  store to attach at create time; harness credentials are injected as
  literal ``env_vars``, resolved BY NAME from the server process
  environment (``sandbox.daytona.env`` config /
  :data:`SANDBOX_ENV_PASSTHROUGH_ENV_VAR`) so secret values never live
  in the server config file.
- **No inbound port forwarding.** Daytona preview links expose sandbox
  ports publicly but provide no local→sandbox path, so
  ``supports_local_port_forward`` stays ``False``.

"""
Provider-agnostic sandbox bootstrap for Omnigent hosts.

Composes a :class:`~omnigent.onboarding.sandboxes.base.SandboxLauncher`
into the full host-bootstrap flow: build the Omnigent wheels locally,
ship + install them in the sandbox, run the Databricks Apps OAuth flow
*inside the sandbox* (driving the browser step from the local machine
over a forwarded callback port), and register the sandbox as a host by
holding ``omnigent host`` open in it. The end state is a sandbox whose
sessions are reachable from the Omnigent server's UI, TUI, and
``omnigent resume``.

The OAuth token is minted and stored by the sandbox's own CLI rather
than shipped from the laptop. Shipping a laptop-minted token was
fundamentally broken: modern CLIs store the live token in the OS
keyring (so the shippable file was stale), the local and in-sandbox CLI
versions disagree on the token-cache layout, and U2M refresh tokens are
single-use — laptop and sandbox can't both hold the same one. Logging
in inside the sandbox makes it the sole token holder and sidesteps all
three.

Everything provider-specific (transport, image quirks, pip flags) lives
behind the launcher; see
:mod:`omnigent.onboarding.sandboxes.lakebox` for the reference
implementation.

    """
    Log the sandbox in to *server_url* by running ``omnigent login``
    **inside the sandbox**, driving the browser step from the local
    machine.

    Databricks Apps front their HTTP/WS endpoints with an OAuth edge —
    workspace PATs (including the Lakebox image's baked credential)
    are rejected; only workspace OAuth tokens pass. ``omnigent
    login`` owns the credential inference used everywhere else: it
    probes *server_url*, discovers the fronting workspace
    from the probe response, mints a workspace OAuth grant (running
    ``databricks auth login --host <workspace>`` when no cached grant
    verifies), and stores a pointer record so ``omnigent host`` and
    runners mint fresh workspace tokens for this server automatically.
    No Databricks profile is created or consulted.

    The sandbox is headless, so when the login needs a browser this:

    1. runs ``omnigent login <server_url>`` inside the sandbox over a
       PTY;
    2. reads the dynamically-chosen loopback callback port back from the
       printed authorize URL;
    3. forwards ``localhost:<port>`` on the local machine into the
       sandbox (and waits for it to bind) so the browser's OAuth
       redirect reaches the in-sandbox listener; and
    4. opens the authorize URL in the local browser.

    When the in-sandbox login completes without printing an authorize
    URL (a cached workspace grant verified against the server), the
    browser steps are skipped and success is read from the exit code.

    The sandbox ends up the sole holder of its OAuth grant — nothing is
    shipped from the laptop — which sidesteps CLI-version cache-format
    skew, OS-keyring storage, and single-use refresh-token rotation.

    For Databricks-fronted servers (*workspace* is not ``None``), the
    sandbox's ``~/.databrickscfg`` is first RESET to exactly one
    ``[DEFAULT]`` entry naming the fronting workspace. Both halves
    matter: the image's baked PAT must go — host-keyed credential
    resolution prefers a host-matching cfg credential, and the Apps
    edge 302s PATs, so it shadows the OAuth grant the login mints —
    and a host entry must exist, because ``databricks auth login``
    stalls on an interactive profile-name prompt when the cfg has no
    entry for its host. The credential-less entry resolves through
    the ``databricks-cli`` token cache (the minted grant), which also
    serves in-sandbox workspace API calls, so nothing is lost with
    the PAT.

    :param launcher: The provider's launcher. Must support
        ``forward_local_port`` (providers without it raise

        server is not Databricks-fronted — the cfg seed is skipped and
        the in-sandbox login runs the server's native (accounts /
        OIDC) flow.

    Register the sandbox as a host by running ``omnigent host`` in it.

    The remote command holds a WebSocket open until interrupted —
    Ctrl-C tears down the foreground transport and the remote process.

    The remote command is always the bare ``omnigent host --server
    <url>``: ``omnigent host`` no longer takes a ``--profile`` flag
    — it resolves credentials itself, via a stored
    ``omnigent login`` token or the sandbox's ambient Databricks
    credentials (e.g. the Lakebox image's baked workspace PAT, which
    authenticates to servers in the sandbox's own workspace).

    When *host_name* is set, the sandbox's
    ``~/.omnigent/config.yaml`` is updated so the host registers
    with that name instead of the default ``socket.gethostname()``.
    This matters for Lakebox sandboxes because all of them share the
    hostname ``databricks``, and the server's ``hosts`` table is

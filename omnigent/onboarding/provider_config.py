"""Read/write the kind-typed model-provider config in ``~/.omnigent/config.yaml``.

For open-source users who route coding agents through a non-Databricks
endpoint (a vendor API key, a subscription CLI login, a gateway like
OpenRouter, a local Ollama, or a Databricks profile), the ``providers:``
block in ``~/.omnigent/config.yaml`` is the source of truth for the
active model selection. Defaults are **per family**: a provider marked
**``default: true``** is the default for the family/families it serves,
so a Claude (``anthropic``) default and a Codex (``openai``) default
coexist (at most one default per family). This mirrors how multi-model
tools key defaults by purpose — Zed's per-feature model pointers,
Continue's per-role models, Goose's lead/worker. (A per-agent spec can
still select a provider explicitly via ``executor.auth: {type: provider,
name: <name>}`` — independent of these defaults.)

This module is the data layer of the model-selection feature (chunk 1a of
``designs/oss-cuj/04-model-selection-implementation.md``). It extends the
family-based provider shape with:

- an explicit **kind** per provider entry — one of ``key`` /
  ``subscription`` / ``gateway`` / ``local`` / ``databricks`` — so the
  readout and routing can describe *how* a provider authenticates;
- a **secret reference** (``api_key_ref: env:<VAR>`` or
  ``keychain:<name>``) as an alternative to an inline ``api_key: $VAR``;
- an **introspection** helper (:func:`describe_active_credential`) that
  resolves the active provider + harness into a :class:`ResolvedCredential`
  for the ``/model`` readout and the ``models`` command — never exposing
  the secret value itself.

Each inline-credential provider (``key`` / ``gateway`` / ``local``) groups
one or more *families*:

- ``anthropic`` — the Anthropic Messages API surface, consumed by the
  Claude SDK harness and native Claude Code.
- ``openai`` — the OpenAI Responses/Chat surface, consumed by the Codex
  harness, native Codex, and the OpenAI-Agents SDK harness.
- ``gemini`` — the Google Gemini surface, the credential the native
  Antigravity (``agy``) onboarding adopts as a ``key``-kind ``gemini:``
  provider from a detected ``GEMINI_API_KEY``.

The ``pi`` harness consumes the ``anthropic`` / ``openai`` families only —
never ``gemini``.

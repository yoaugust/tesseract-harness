"""Host-side checks for whether a harness family's inference is AI-Gateway-backed.

Smart Routing's apply layer can only rewrite a launch's model when the launch
resolves through the Databricks AI Gateway — that is where the routable model
catalog lives. These checks answer that question per harness family from config
resolution alone: no process launch, no network round-trip, so the host can
report the answer alongside harness readiness on every registration.

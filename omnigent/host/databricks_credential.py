"""Point a managed sandbox's Databricks auth at the owner's per-user broker.

Called by ``omnigent host`` at startup (executor-agnostic, like
:func:`omnigent.git_credential_github.configure_host_git`). When the owner has
linked a Databricks workspace via the OAuth U2M connect flow, the host writes a
host-only ``[omnigent]`` ``~/.databrickscfg`` profile (workspace ``host`` only,
**no token**), exports ``DATABRICKS_CONFIG_PROFILE``, and drops a private
sidecar recording the broker coordinates (server URL, host id, launch token).

The Databricks **bearer is never persisted in the sandbox**. Instead, the
command-based harnesses (codex / claude / pi) mint it on demand: their gateway
auth command falls back to :func:`main` here, which fetches the owner's
server-refreshed token from the generic credential broker
(:mod:`omnigent.server.routes.host_credentials`, ``provider=databricks``) each
time it runs — the same per-op broker fetch the GitHub credential helper uses.
The harness re-runs that command as tokens near expiry, so a long session
refreshes without relaunch.

The launch token in the sidecar is a lesser, expiring credential already present
in this disposable sandbox (git's credential helper bakes the same token into
``~/.gitconfig``); the owner's Databricks token is not. Best-effort throughout:
a no-op when the host token is absent, the broker is unreachable, the feature is
off, or the owner hasn't connected Databricks (the sandbox then keeps whatever
ambient ``~/.databrickscfg`` it already had).

Scope: this wires the *command-based* gateway harnesses. The opencode-native
gateway and the Databricks MCP resolver read a static profile token via the SDK
and are intentionally not wired here; a host-only profile makes them fall back
to their ambient config until a broker-backed resolver lands for them.

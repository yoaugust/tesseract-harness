"""Persistent background local Omnigent server lifecycle.

When ``run`` / ``claude`` / ``codex`` are invoked without a
``--server`` URL, the work happens against a server that lives on *this*
machine. Rather than a command-scoped server torn down on exit, that
server is detached, shared, and reused across invocations — tracked by a
pidfile like the connect daemon — so the Web UI stays reachable after the
command exits and a second invocation reuses the same server + state.

These helpers live under ``omnigent/host/`` (not ``cli.py``) so the
connect daemon can import and own the server's lifecycle: the daemon is
the only process that starts the local server, and the CLI discovers its
URL via the pidfile this module writes. The module deliberately avoids
importing ``cli.py`` to keep that dependency direction clean.

    Compute a signature of the server-affecting config for one invocation.

    The daemon (in local mode) spawns the Omnigent server once and never
    re-reads its spawn config, so a reused server silently keeps the auth
    mode — and the *code* — it was born with. Stamping this signature lets
    reuse detect when a later invocation wants a *different* server (e.g.
    the user flips ``OMNIGENT_AUTH_ENABLED``, or upgrades the package) and
    respawn instead of serving the stale one.

    Covers the inputs that change server behavior at spawn time:

    * the resolved auth source — auth mode is baked at boot and cannot be
      reconfigured in place;
    * the enabled release-feature set — features are snapshotted at boot; and
    * custom session-title instructions — title metadata is configured at boot;
      and
    * the installed package version — a running server holds its code in
      memory, so after ``omni upgrade`` (or a manual ``uv tool upgrade``)
      the old process keeps serving pre-upgrade code until it is cycled.
      Folding the version in makes the next CLI command notice the drift
      and respawn the server on the new code through the existing
      config-drift path in :func:`ensure_local_omnigent_server` — no
      explicit restart required.

    Deliberately narrow otherwise, so unrelated env churn does not force
    needless restarts.

"""Client-side helpers for launching runners through the connect daemon.

These are the CLI-side counterpart to the host-runner protocol: the CLI
(``run`` / ``claude`` / ``codex``) asks the Omnigent server to launch
a runner on this machine's daemon via
``POST /v1/hosts/{host_id}/runners``; the server forwards a launch frame to
the daemon, which spawns the runner subprocess and binds it to the session.
The daemon owns the runner lifecycle — the CLI only connects.

Harness-agnostic on purpose: the same launch path serves headless
``run`` agents and the ``claude``/``codex`` terminal wrappers.

"""Host-side client for the runner zygote forkserver.

The host daemon talks to a single long-lived zygote process
(:mod:`omnigent.runner._zygote`) over an ``AF_UNIX`` socketpair. The zygote
imports the runner graph once and ``os.fork()``s a child per session, so the
~120MB import floor is shared copy-on-write instead of paid per runner.

This module owns:

* :class:`ZygoteManager` — lazily spawns the zygote (a plain ``Popen`` of a
  fresh interpreter, so it never inherits the daemon's asyncio loop / threads),
  and exposes ``fork_runner`` plus the poll/terminate/kill primitives the
  daemon needs.
* :class:`ZygoteRunnerProc` — a minimal stand-in for ``subprocess.Popen`` that
  ``_RunnerHandle`` and the daemon's watch/stop/cleanup paths use unchanged. The
  daemon is NOT the forked runner's OS parent, so ``poll``/``returncode``/
  ``wait`` round-trip to the zygote (the real parent) for exit status, while
  ``terminate``/``kill`` signal the pid directly.

This code runs on any POSIX host (the gate is ``IS_POSIX``); the copy-on-write
*savings* are Linux-specific, but the fork/protocol path executes on macOS too.
On by default; set ``OMNIGENT_RUNNER_ZYGOTE=0`` to opt out. The daemon falls
back to direct ``Popen`` on any failure, so the zygote is never a hard
dependency.

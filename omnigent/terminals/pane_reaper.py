"""Idle reaper for native-harness terminal panes (issue #1349).

Native CLI sessions (``claude-native`` / ``codex-native`` / ``cursor-native`` /
...) run their vendor CLI plus a full MCP fleet inside a persistent tmux pane
held for the whole conversation lifetime. Unlike the SDK harness proxies — which
``HarnessProcessManager._idle_reaper_loop`` reaps after an idle window — these
panes have no idle reaper, so on a shared/multi-conversation runner memory grows
without bound as idle conversations accumulate, independent of how many are
actually active (#1349).

This reaps a single native pane only when it is genuinely unused. "Busy" is the
disjunction of three signals (any one spares the pane):

  * an in-flight runner turn (``has_active_turn``), OR
  * the pane's PTY watcher currently reports ``running`` — i.e. the vendor CLI is
    working autonomously *between* runner turns (native turns clear the runner's
    ``_active_turns`` right after the prompt is pasted, so this is the load-bearing
    signal for a long autonomous turn), OR
  * a tmux client is attached (a human is watching the pane).

A pane idle on all three for longer than the window is reaped, with a **second
busy re-check immediately before teardown** to close the select→reap race. The
tmux client probe is a blocking ``subprocess`` call, so it runs off the event
loop via ``asyncio.to_thread``.

Teardown is **pane-scoped** (``reap`` closes only the one native terminal, not
the conversation's other terminals), leaving the session's primary OSEnv +
server-side transcript intact — the next message re-creates the pane and the
vendor CLI resumes via its own ``--resume``.

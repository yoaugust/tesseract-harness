"""Built-in GitHub access policy (MCP- and shell-agnostic).

A single factory, :func:`github_policy`, gating GitHub access across two
surfaces an Omnigent agent can reach GitHub through:

- **MCP tool calls** — both the official per-operation GitHub MCP server
  (``get_file_contents`` / ``create_or_update_file`` / ``push_files`` /
  ``create_pull_request`` / ``merge_pull_request`` …) and the layered
  HTTP-proxy wrapper that splits verbs at the tool-name level
  (``github_read_api_call`` / ``github_write_api_call``).
- **``git`` / ``gh`` shell commands** dispatched through ``sys_os_shell``
  (the built-in OS shell tool). The command string is parsed; commands that
  never touch the remote (``git status`` / ``git commit`` / ``git diff`` …)
  are ignored, while remote reads (``git clone`` / ``gh pr view``) and writes
  (``git push`` / ``gh pr create`` / ``gh repo delete``) are gated.

This deliberately does NOT cover the raw GitHub HTTP API hit directly from the
sandbox (``curl https://api.github.com`` or ``git`` over HTTPS bypassing the
shell tool). Enforcing that path requires an HTTP forwarding gateway, which is
a separate enforcement point the runtime does not have today.

Enforcement is a **pure allowlist** (no created-resource tracking, so the
policy is stateless and only ever inspects ``tool_call`` events):

- Reads are allowed everywhere when ``read_all`` is ``True`` (default). When
  ``read_all`` is ``False``, reads are restricted to ``read_repos``.
- Writes are restricted to ``write_repos`` and, when ``write_branches`` is set,
  to those branches.
- When a *shell* command is a gated read/write but its target repo (or, for a
  branch-restricted write, its target branch) cannot be determined from the
  command text — e.g. ``git push origin main``, where ``origin`` is a local
  remote alias the policy cannot resolve to a repo — the decision is **ASK**
  (human approval) rather than a guess. MCP tool calls carry structured
  ``owner``/``repo`` args, so an MCP write with no determinable repo is instead
  DENYed as anomalous.

Repos are matched case-insensitively as ``owner/repo`` (GitHub treats them so);
branches are matched exactly (git branch names are case-sensitive). Both bare
``owner/repo`` strings and full GitHub URLs (``https://github.com/owner/repo``,
``git@github.com:owner/repo.git``) are accepted in the allowlists and parsed
out of arguments / command text.

MCP-agnostic: tools are recognized by their *canonical* name after stripping a
server prefix (default ``mcp__github__`` / ``github__``; override via
``mcp_tool_prefixes``). A tool that carried a GitHub server prefix but cannot be
classified as read or write fails closed (DENY) — we will not let an
unrecognized GitHub operation through. Tools with no GitHub prefix are only
claimed when their canonical name is a known GitHub operation, so the policy
composes freely with non-GitHub policies (it abstains on everything else).

The factory must be referenced via ``function: {path, arguments}`` with a
non-empty ``arguments`` block (the registry declares it ``kind: "factory"``).

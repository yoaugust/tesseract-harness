"""Built-in working-directory / worktree policy (shell-surface).

A single factory, :func:`block_working_dir_changes`, that gates shell commands
which move the agent out of its current working directory or switch git
worktrees. It addresses the "I don't want the agent to switch working
directories or worktrees" guardrail: an agent confined to a workspace should
not be able to ``cd`` elsewhere or spin up / relocate a linked worktree and
operate from there.

It gates two things, dispatched off ``sys_os_shell`` (the built-in OS shell
tool) ``command`` strings:

- **Directory changes** (``block_cd``) — ``cd`` / ``chdir`` / ``pushd`` /
  ``popd`` shell built-ins, plus ``git -C <path> …`` (which runs git as if in
  another directory). When ``allowed_dirs`` is set, a ``cd`` into one of those
  directories (or a subdirectory) is permitted; everything else is gated.
- **Worktree switches** (``block_worktree``) — ``git worktree add`` /
  ``move`` / ``remove``, the subcommands that create, relocate, or delete a
  linked working tree. Read-only / maintenance worktree subcommands
  (``list`` / ``prune`` / ``lock`` / ``unlock`` / ``repair``) are not gated —
  they do not switch the agent into a different tree.

Like the GitHub built-in, the command string is parsed robustly: commands are
split on chaining operators (``cd /x && …``), wrapper / env prefixes are
stripped (``sudo`` / ``env`` / ``VAR=x``), and shell-interpreter / ``eval``
wrappers (``bash -c "cd /x"``) are unwrapped and re-parsed — so the gate
cannot be bypassed by chaining or wrapping. A segment that looks like a gated
command but cannot be tokenized (e.g. unbalanced quotes) is surfaced via the
configured ``action`` rather than silently allowed.

The policy abstains (returns ``None``) on every event that is not a gated
shell command, so it composes freely with other policies.

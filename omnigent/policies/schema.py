"""Typed contracts for policy function callables.

Defines the exact shapes of the ``event`` dict passed TO a policy
callable and the ``response`` dict returned FROM it. These are
``TypedDict`` definitions — they are not enforced at runtime (the
actual coercion lives in :func:`_coerce_to_policy_result` in
:mod:`omnigent.policies.function`), but they serve as the
authoritative reference for authors implementing policy callables.

Usage in a policy callable::

    from omnigent.policies.schema import PolicyEvent, PolicyResponse

    def my_policy(event: PolicyEvent) -> PolicyResponse | None:
        if event["type"] != "tool_call":
            return None  # abstain
        tool = event["data"].get("tool", "")
        if tool == "dangerous_tool":
            return {"result": "DENY", "reason": "Blocked."}
        return {"result": "ALLOW"}

Two-argument form (with config)::

    def my_policy(event: PolicyEvent, config: dict[str, str]) -> PolicyResponse | None:
        limit = int(config.get("limit", "10"))
        ...

Factory form (with ``factory_params``)::

    def create_policy(limit: int = 10) -> PolicyCallable:
        def evaluate(event: PolicyEvent) -> PolicyResponse | None:
            ...
        return evaluate

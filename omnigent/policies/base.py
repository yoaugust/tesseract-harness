"""
Abstract base class for policy evaluator instances.

A :class:`Policy` is an instantiated, per-workflow evaluator
derived from a :class:`PolicySpec`. Subclasses implement one
:meth:`evaluate` method that returns a :class:`PolicyResult`;
the engine (in :mod:`omnigent.runtime.policies.engine`) does
the filter-gate-dispatch-compose orchestration (see
POLICIES.md §4).

The two concrete subclasses live next to this module:

- :class:`omnigent.policies.function.FunctionPolicy`
- :class:`omnigent.policies.prompt.PromptPolicy`

These classes are pure evaluators — they hold no mutable state
across calls, do no DB I/O, and don't know about conversations.
Mutable runtime state (label cache, conversation id,
write-through store) and the composition loop live in
:mod:`omnigent.runtime.policies`.

    selector and condition gates match the current context;
    implementations therefore don't need to re-check those.

        Reset per-turn state, if any.

        Stateless policies (the default) ignore this. Stateful
        policies whose author callable advertises per-turn
        accumulators — e.g. the ``max_tool_calls_per_turn``
        rate-limit factory in
        ``examples/_shared/rate_limit_policy.py`` — override
        this to clear those counters at the start of each
        turn. Mirrors :meth:`omnigent.runtime.policies.engine.PolicyEngine.reset_turn`.

        The runtime calls this once per "turn" — defined as one
        user prompt → terminal assistant response cycle, which
        in omnigent corresponds to one ``_run_agent_loop``
        invocation. Sub-iteration steps (tool calls within a
        turn) do NOT trigger a reset.

        Deliberately a concrete no-op (not ``@abstractmethod``)
        so subclasses opt INTO per-turn lifecycle handling
        rather than being forced to override; same convention
        as :meth:`omnigent.runtime.policies.engine.PolicyEngine.reset_turn`.

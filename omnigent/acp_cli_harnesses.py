"""Declarative catalog of builtin ACP CLI harnesses.

One row here is one first-class harness backed by a vendor CLI that speaks the
Agent Client Protocol on stdio (the ``goose acp`` / ``qwen --acp`` family).
Rows are pure data; every registration a row needs derives from this table:

- registry entries (validity, module routing, aliases, picker label,
  capabilities, install spec, install keys): ``omnigent/harness_plugins.py``
- readiness: the generic install-key gate in
  ``omnigent/onboarding/harness_readiness.py`` (binary on PATH)
- setup steps and one-click installability:
  ``omnigent/onboarding/harness_install.py``
- spawn env: :func:`omnigent.runtime.workflow._build_acp_cli_spawn_env`
- dispatch: ``_build_spawn_env_from_spec`` in ``omnigent/runner/app.py``
- live e2e matrix exclusion:
  ``tests/e2e/omnigent/test_run_harness_without_agent_e2e.py``

Every row runs through the shared generic wrap
(``omnigent/inner/acp_harness.py``) and :class:`~omnigent.inner.acp_executor.
AcpExecutor` — the same code path a user-configured ``acp:<slug>`` agent uses.
To promote a new ACP-speaking vendor CLI to a builtin harness, add one row and
its docs; do not add a new inner module, registry entries, or a per-harness
spawn-env builder. Rows own their auth and model selection (``OWN_AUTH``): no
Omnigent credential or model override is wired, so a ``/model`` pick is
rejected up front rather than silently dropped.

One consequence worth knowing before adding a row: the generic ACP spawn env is
deny-by-default and a row has no ``env_passthrough`` of its own (only a
user-configured ``acp:<slug>`` agent can declare one), so a row's CLI reaches the
agent with the base environment only. A vendor that configures or authenticates
*solely* from an environment variable therefore needs a user-configured agent
rather than a row here; a vendor that reads stored credentials from disk (Devin,
Grok's OAuth login) works as a row.

This module stays import-light (stdlib + :mod:`omnigent.harness_install_spec`)
so the registry, onboarding, and runner layers can all read it without cycles.

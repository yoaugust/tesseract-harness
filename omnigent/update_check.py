"""Lightweight CLI update reminder.

Two install shapes are supported:

* **Dev clone** (``git clone … && uv sync`` / ``pip install -e .``): we
  walk up from this module to find a ``.git/`` directory, then run
  ``git fetch`` and ``rev-list`` to count how many commits ``HEAD`` is
  behind ``origin/main`` (or ``origin/master``). The result is cached
  to ``~/.omnigent/.update_check.json`` so the (potentially slow)
  ``git fetch`` only runs once per staleness window. The notice points
  the user at ``git pull``.

* **Installed wheel** (``uv tool install omnigent``,
  ``pip install omnigent``, ``pipx install``, Homebrew, etc.): no clone
  is reachable on disk, so we compare the installed version against the
  latest release on the *configured package index* (via the Simple
  Repository API — :func:`fetch_latest_version`) and nag *only when a
  strictly newer release exists* — never merely because the install is
  old. The index is resolved from ``OMNIGENT_INDEX_URL`` /
  ``UV_INDEX_URL`` / ``PIP_INDEX_URL`` or, failing those, the uv/pip
  *config files* (``uv.toml`` / ``pip.conf``); default pypi.org. So it
  works on corporate mirrors and air-gapped networks — even when the
  mirror is configured in a file rather than an env var — and stays
  consistent with what ``omni upgrade`` actually pulls. To avoid adding
  latency to the hot
  path, the foreground only ever reads the cached "latest version" and
  prints from it; the (network) lookup runs in a detached background
  process (:func:`refresh_update_cache`) that refreshes the cache for the
  next invocation. The notice fires once per new release (tracked via
  ``last_notified_version``) and points the user at ``omni upgrade``.

The dispatcher in ``maybe_show_update_notice`` picks the shape based on
whether a ``.git/`` directory is reachable from this module's path.

    no password — which for an SSH remote is just the login user — is

    The SSH user is not a secret (it is ``git`` for GitHub, GitLab,

    literal user ``****`` and fails with ``Permission denied

    the metadata, so we restore the canonical ``git`` — the only SSH
    user those hosts accept — which makes both the command we display
    and the command we run match and actually work.

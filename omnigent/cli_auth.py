"""CLI-side auth storage for ``omnigent login``.

Persists per-server auth state in ``~/.omnigent/auth_tokens.json``
keyed by server URL. Three record shapes live side by side:

- **Session JWTs** from the browser-based OIDC / accounts login flow
  (``{"token": ..., "user_id": ..., "expires_at": ...}``).
- **Databricks Apps pointer records**
  (``{"auth_type": "databricks", "workspace_host": ...}``) written by
  ``omnigent login <apps-url>``. These deliberately store NO token:
  Databricks OAuth access tokens expire after ~1 hour, so the record
  just names the workspace whose host-keyed Databricks CLI OAuth cache
  (``databricks auth login --host <ws>``) mints fresh bearers on
  demand.
- **Workspace routing selectors** (``{"org_id": ...}``) remembered while
  normalizing a managed URL. They may stand alone or augment either credential
  record so subprocesses route to the same workspace.

        (e.g. :class:`_RunnerDatabricksAuth`, which re-injects a fresh bearer and
        the routing headers on the OAuth-redirect retry). Mutually exclusive with

    :param bearer_token: A static workspace bearer, folded in as

        there is none.
    :param headers: Extra request headers (e.g. the runner ``Origin`` sentinel).
        Merged *under* the routing headers, so routing always wins over a
        caller-supplied collision.
    :param timeout: An httpx timeout (``httpx.Timeout``, ``float``, or ``None``
        to disable). Omitted by default so httpx applies its own default rather
        than this factory silently overriding it.
    :param follow_redirects: Passed through to httpx. Defaults to ``False``

        flow that re-mints on the Databricks Apps OAuth login redirect — keep it

        default network transport. Its one production-adjacent use is injecting a
        test transport (e.g. ``httpx.MockTransport``); ``None`` uses the default.
    :param host_id: The host a request is scoped to, forwarded to
        :func:`databricks_request_headers` (which emits it as the slice-key only
        on a host-sharded mount and otherwise falls back to the runner's own

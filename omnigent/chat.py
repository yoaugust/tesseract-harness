    :param resume_conversation_id: When set, the REPL opens

        creating a fresh one — replays recent items and

    :param resume_latest: When ``True``, resolve "the most
        recent conversation for this agent" against the
        persistent store after the server boots and attach
        the REPL to it. Maps to ``--continue`` on the CLI.

        target raises :class:`click.ClickException`. Mutually
        exclusive with *resume_conversation_id* — the latter
        takes precedence if both are set.
    :param resume_picker: When ``True``, open the interactive
        stderr/stdin picker after the server boots and let
        the user choose a conversation. Maps to ``--resume``
        / ``-r`` with no value on the CLI. Local-mode only — passing this
        with a remote URL target raises
        :class:`click.ClickException` (the picker has no way
        to scope to a single agent on a multi-agent remote
        server without an explicit hand-off). Precedence:
        ``resume_conversation_id`` wins over ``resume_picker``
        wins over ``resume_latest``; user-cancelled picker
        falls through to a fresh conversation.
    :param fork_session_id: When set, fork this session before
        entering the REPL. The fork creates a deep copy of the
        source session's items into a new session; the REPL then
        opens attached to the fork. Maps to ``--fork ID`` on the
        CLI. Mutually exclusive with ``resume_conversation_id``,
        ``resume_latest``, and ``resume_picker``.
    :param log: When ``True``, write a JSON dump of the active
        conversation to ``~/.omnigent/logs/`` on REPL exit.
        Maps to ``--log`` on the CLI (default-on for the legacy
        path, default-off here so it stays explicit on
        Omnigent mode). See ``omnigent.repl._session_log`` for the
        schema. Local-mode only — passing this with a remote
        URL target raises :class:`click.ClickException`
        (no client-side conversation hand-off to dump).
    :param debug_events: When ``True``, enable the SSE-to-UI debug
        pipeline (event tape overlay via ``Ctrl+E``, JSONL event
        logging to ``~/.omnigent/debug/``, and pipeline stage
        counters in the toolbar). Maps to ``--debug-events`` on the
        CLI.
    :param resume_parts: Pre-built argument list prefix for the
        resume hint, e.g. ``["omnigent", "run", "agent.yaml",
        "--server", "https://example.com"]``.  Built from Click's
        parsed context at CLI dispatch time.  ``None`` omits the

        ``resume_conversation_id``, run one request and exit. If set
        with ``resume_conversation_id``, auto-send when the REPL
        opens.
    :param resume_conversation_id: When set, the REPL opens
        attached to this existing conversation on the remote
        server instead of creating a fresh one.
    :param fork_session_id: When set, fork this session before
        entering the REPL. The REPL opens attached to the fork.

        requests, e.g. ``"runner_0123456789abcdef"``.
    :param runner_recover: Optional callback that restarts a local
        runner if it exits and returns the live runner id.
    :param log: When ``True``, write a session log on REPL exit.
    :param agent_yaml: Optional local agent YAML path for tmux
        pane re-launch metadata.
    :param session_bundle: Optional gzipped agent bundle bytes used
        to create a fresh ``/v1/sessions`` session. Required for
        fresh sessions on the sessions API path.
    :param session_bundle_filename: Filename for the multipart
        ``bundle`` part, e.g. ``"agent.tar.gz"``.
    :param ephemeral: When ``True``, suppress the resume hint on
        exit — the session data lives in a tmpdir that won't
        survive process exit.

        pipeline. Forwarded to ``_run_repl``.

        stdout/stderr log file, e.g.

        Ctrl+O debug overview. ``None`` for remote servers.

        stdout/stderr log file, e.g.
        ``Path("~/.omnigent/logs/runner/runner-abc123.log")``. Shown in the
        Ctrl+O debug overview. ``None`` when no local runner is used.
    :param resume_parts: Pre-built argument list prefix for the
        resume command shown on exit, e.g.
        ``["omnigent", "run", "agent.yaml", "--harness", "codex"]``.
        ``None`` uses the current process argv.
    :param auto_open_conversation: When ``True``, open the
        browser conversation URL when the session id becomes known.
    :param skills: Parsed skill list from the agent spec, e.g.
        ``[SkillSpec(name="code-review", ...)]``. Each skill is
        registered as a ``/<name>`` slash command in the REPL.
        ``None`` (default) means no skill commands are registered.

        bring-up path, or ``None``. It stays up (on its last label,
        ``"Launching your agent…"``) across the wrapper-redirect probe and

    exception message instead of being lost to the subprocess's
    silenced stderr.

    neither harness nor model), the source spec is materialized into

    response server-side:

    :param agent_yaml: Path to the agent spec on the local
        filesystem, when known. Threaded through to the tmux
        pane-integration helper so a sibling pane spawned via
        ``prefix + <split-key>`` can re-launch the same agent.
        ``None`` for remote-URL targets (the spec lives on the
        server, not locally) — the chooser falls back to
        ``OPT_LAUNCH_ARGV`` in that case.
    :param runner_id: Optional preferred runner id to send on
        requests, e.g. ``"runner_0123456789abcdef"``.
    :param runner_recover: Optional callback that restarts the
        local runner if it has exited and returns the live runner
        id.
    :param session_bundle: Optional gzipped agent bundle bytes used
        to create a fresh sessions-API session. Required for fresh
        sessions.
    :param session_bundle_filename: Multipart filename, e.g.
        ``"agent.tar.gz"``.
    :param ephemeral: When ``True``, suppress the resume hint on
        exit — the session data lives in a tmpdir that's gone
        after the process exits, so the hint would be misleading.
    :param debug_events: When ``True``, enable the SSE-to-UI debug
        pipeline (event tape overlay, JSONL log, toolbar counters).
        Maps to ``--debug-events`` on the CLI.
    :param server_log_path: Path to the local server's
        stdout/stderr log file, e.g.
        ``Path("~/.omnigent/logs/server/server-abc123.log")``. Shown in the
        Ctrl+O debug overview. ``None`` for remote servers.
    :param runner_log_path: Path to the local runner's
        stdout/stderr log file, e.g.
        ``Path("~/.omnigent/logs/runner/runner-abc123.log")``. Shown in the
        Ctrl+O debug overview. ``None`` when no local runner is used.
    :param resume_parts: Pre-built argument list prefix for the
        resume command shown on exit, e.g.
        ``["omnigent", "run", "agent.yaml", "--harness", "codex"]``.
        ``None`` uses the current process argv.
    :param skills: Parsed skill list from the agent spec, e.g.
        ``[SkillSpec(name="code-review", ...)]``. Each skill is
        registered as a ``/<name>`` slash command in the REPL.
        ``None`` (default) means no skill commands are registered.
    :param auto_open_conversation: When ``True``, open the
        browser conversation URL when the session id becomes known.

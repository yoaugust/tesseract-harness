"""Scheduled-task entities — persisted in the ``scheduled_tasks`` and
``scheduled_task_runs`` tables.

A :class:`ScheduledTask` is a saved, scheduled instruction that fires an agent
session on a recurring schedule (``rrule``). A
:class:`ScheduledTaskRun` records one firing of a task (its run history). This
module holds the plain dataclasses the store converts ORM rows into; the store
owns the JSON (de)serialization of the Text-backed columns.

Naming: the user-facing product name for this feature is "Automations"
(web UI display copy only). The domain model, DB tables
(``scheduled_tasks`` / ``scheduled_task_runs``), stores, REST paths
(``/v1/scheduled-tasks``), agent tools (``sys_scheduled_task_*``), and
these types deliberately keep the name "scheduled task". Keep code,
comments, and schema on "scheduled task"; only presentation strings say
"Automations".

@dataclass
class ScheduledTask:
    """
    A scheduled task persisted in the ``scheduled_tasks`` table.

    A task's trigger is a required recurring ``rrule``.

    :param id: UUID primary key (bare 32-char hex string, no dashes).
    :param workspace_id: Tenant partition key that owns this row.
    :param name: Human-readable task name, e.g. ``"nightly triage"``.
    :param prompt: The instruction dispatched to the agent on each firing.
    :param rrule: The required RFC 5545 recurrence rule for the recurring
        trigger, e.g. ``"FREQ=DAILY;BYHOUR=9;BYMINUTE=0"``. Evaluated in
        ``timezone``.
    :param user_id: User the spawned session's ``LEVEL_OWNER`` grant is
        written for, e.g. ``"alice@example.com"``. ``None`` in single-user mode.
    :param agent_id: The agent bound to this task, e.g. ``"ag_..."``.
    :param timezone: IANA timezone the trigger is evaluated in,
        e.g. ``"America/Los_Angeles"``.
    :param created_at: Unix epoch seconds at row creation.
    :param model_override: Per-task LLM model override, e.g.
        ``"claude-opus-4-7"``. ``None`` means use the agent default.
    :param reasoning_effort: Per-task reasoning-effort hint, e.g. ``"high"``.
        ``None`` means use the agent default.
    :param permission_mode: Per-task permission mode for native coding harnesses
        that support one (currently Claude Code), e.g. ``"acceptEdits"`` or
        ``"bypassPermissions"``. The fire path turns it into the runner's
        ``["--permission-mode", <value>]`` terminal launch args. ``None`` means
        use the agent's configured default.
    :param max_cost_usd: Optional per-firing cost budget in USD. When set, the
        fire path attaches a ``cost_budget`` policy to each spawned session that
        blocks all models once cumulative spend reaches this limit. ``None``
        means no per-firing cost cap (the session runs unconstrained unless the
        agent spec or server-wide defaults impose one).
    :param workspace: Absolute existing path where a fired session's connected
        host runner should start. ``None`` only for legacy or invalid rows.
    :param base_branch: Reserved legacy column; scheduled tasks currently do
        not create git worktrees at fire time.
    :param execution_target: Reserved legacy column; scheduled tasks currently
        run only on ``"connected_host"``.
    :param host_id: Specific connected host to run on. ``None`` only for legacy
        or invalid rows.
    :param state: Lifecycle state — one of ``"active"``, ``"paused"``,
        ``"deleted"``. Defaults to ``"active"``.
    :param last_run_at: Unix epoch seconds of the most recent firing, or
        ``None`` if it has never fired.
    :param last_run_conversation_id: Conversation created by the most recent
        firing, or ``None``.
    :param updated_at: Unix epoch seconds of the last write, or ``None`` if the
        row has never been updated.

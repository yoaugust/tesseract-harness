"""Project entity — persisted in the ``projects`` table.

A :class:`Project` is a user-defined, owner-private container that groups
related sessions. It exists independently of its member sessions (it can be
empty), which is why it is a first-class row rather than the implicit
``omni_project`` label it supersedes. Session membership lives on the
conversation's metadata row (``project_id``), not here.

    A project persisted in the ``projects`` table.

    :param id: UUID primary key (bare 32-char hex string, no dashes).
    :param name: Human-readable project name, unique per owner.
    :param user_id: User the project belongs to, e.g.
        ``"alice@example.com"``. ``None`` in single-user mode. Ownership is
        stamped on the row (not derived from a permission table) because
        projects are owner-private and carry no ACL of their own.
    :param created_at: Unix epoch seconds at row creation.
    :param updated_at: Unix epoch seconds of the last write, or ``None`` if the
        row has never been updated.
    :param config: Default session settings as an opaque JSON object (host,
        workspace, harness, model, reasoning effort, git base-branch, …), or an
        empty dict when none are stored. The key vocabulary is owned by the
        client; the store persists and returns it whole. These are hints the
        new-chat dialog pre-fills, not enforced requirements.

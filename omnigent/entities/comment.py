class Comment:
    """A single review comment anchored to a text range in a file.

    :param id: UUID for this comment, e.g. ``"a1b2c3d4-..."``.
    :param conversation_id: The conversation this comment belongs to,
        e.g. ``"conv_abc123"``.
    :param path: File path relative to the workspace root,
        e.g. ``"src/App.tsx"``.
    :param start_index: 0-based absolute character offset (inclusive)
        within the file where the anchor range begins.
    :param end_index: 0-based absolute character offset (exclusive)
        within the file where the anchor range ends.
    :param body: The comment text.
    :param status: One of ``"draft"`` (open, not yet addressed)
        or ``"addressed"`` (fixed by the agent or user).
    :param created_at: Unix timestamp (seconds) when the comment was
        created.
    :param updated_at: Unix timestamp in **microseconds** when the
        comment was last mutated (body or status change); set at
        creation time for never-edited comments. Microsecond precision
        (vs ``created_at``'s seconds) so back-to-back mutations inside
        the same second still produce distinct, ordered values for the
        session comments fingerprint, while staying an exact integer
        in JavaScript (epoch-µs < ``Number.MAX_SAFE_INTEGER``).
    :param anchor_content: Plain-text snapshot of the selected range at
        comment creation time. Used to re-anchor the comment when the
        file is subsequently edited. ``None`` for legacy comments.
    :param created_by: Email of the user who created the comment,
        e.g. ``"alice@example.com"``. ``None`` for legacy comments created
        before per-user attribution was added, or in single-user mode.

    Consumed by the session-list surfaces (``GET /v1/sessions`` and

"""Import-safe declarative capability model for harness plugins.

A harness's feature support was previously implicit — scattered across
``if harness == "x"`` branches and the presence/absence of companion modules
(``codex_native_elicitation.py``, ``*_native_hook.py``, ``*_native_permissions.py``).
This module gives it one declared shape so the registry can answer "what can
this harness do?" directly.

Like :mod:`omnigent.harness_install_spec`, this type lives outside the
onboarding/provider stack so an optional harness plugin can declare its
capabilities during entry-point discovery without triggering import cycles.
Each :class:`~omnigent.harness_plugins.HarnessContribution` carries a
per-harness ``capabilities`` map of these records.

The axes align with the harness-integration-guide feature matrix.

    :param resume: Whether a prior conversation is reattached or rebuilt.
    :param effort: Which reasoning-effort value set applies.
    :param model_family: Which model vendors the harness accepts.
    :param auth: Where the harness's credentials come from.
    :param subagents: Whether the harness can spawn Omnigent sub-agents.
    :param interrupt: Whether a running turn can be cancelled mid-stream. This
        is a *declared* claim; the harness bench's interrupt probe verifies it
        live and flags drift when a harness does not honor it.
    :param streaming: Whether the harness forwards token-level deltas (vs a
        single complete blob). Declared claim; verified by the bench's
        streaming probe.
    :param steering: Whether input can be added to an active turn.
    :param live_queue: Whether follow-up input can be queued during an active
        turn.
    :param images: Whether the harness accepts image input.
    :param compaction: Whether the harness can compact conversation history.
        Optional capability fields use ``None`` when the harness makes no claim;
        the bench reports those declarations as ``UNKNOWN`` rather than assuming
        the capability is unsupported.
    :param fork_history: How a fork / in-place agent switch carries prior history
        into the harness — ``none`` (fresh), ``rebuild`` (rebuild the vendor's
        resumable session file from copied items), or ``preamble`` (replay prior
        turns as a text preamble). Drives the server's fork-history gating.
    :param shell_tool_name: The harness's shell/exec tool name the harness bench
        provokes to verify tool-calling (e.g. ``"Bash"``, ``"shell"``). ``None``
        skips the bench's tool/policy probe for this harness.
    :param shell_tool_prompt: The prompt the bench sends to provoke that tool.
        Must contain the ``omnigent-bench-ok`` placeholder the probe token-swaps.
        ``None`` skips the probe.
    :param instruction_delivery: Whether and how ``AgentSpec.instructions``
        reach the vendor agent. Defaults to ``UNKNOWN`` for undeclared/
        third-party harnesses.

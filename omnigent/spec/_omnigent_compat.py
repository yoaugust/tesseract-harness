"""Omnigent compatibility surface — bundled for surgical removal.

🚨 **TECH DEBT — REMOVE WHEN OMNIGENT COMPAT WORKSTREAM ENDS.**
This entire module exists *only* to support the Omnigent
integration (see ``designs/OMNIGENT_INTEGRATION.md``). It
consolidates every omnigent-specific addition that would otherwise
be scattered across ``validator.py``, ``spec/__init__.py``, and
``runtime/workflow.py``.

When Omnigent is consolidated (phase 6 of the integration design),
deleting Omnigent support means:

1. Delete this file.
2. Remove the few lines in ``validator.py``,
   ``spec/__init__.py``, and ``runtime/workflow.py`` that import
   from it (each has a single import + a single call site —
   grep for ``_omnigent_compat`` to find them).
3. Delete ``omnigent/spec/omnigent.py`` (the bidirectional
   translator).
4. The Omnigent executor module is already gone (it held an
   experimental executor ABC that has since been removed), so
   there is nothing left to delete here.
5. Remove ``ExecutorSpec.config`` from
   ``omnigent/spec/types.py`` (the only field that couldn't
   move here because Python dataclasses don't support
   externally-added fields).

That's it. No grep-the-codebase exercise; the surface is
intentionally tiny.

**Do NOT** treat this module as a general-purpose extension point
for new executor types. Add concrete typed fields and dedicated
validator branches instead.

def materialize_bundle(source: Path, dest: Path) -> Path:
    """
    Copy a spec source into *dest* as a uniform bundle directory.

    Agent-plane accepts two source shapes: an agent-image directory
    (``config.yaml`` + bundled assets) or a standalone omnigent
    YAML file. Downstream code (``_preregister_agent``,
    ``_prepare_omnigent_yaml_bundle``) always wants to operate on a
    directory it can tar, mutate, or hand to the in-process
    omnigent server.

    Taking the file-vs-directory branch once — here — means every
    caller downstream is uniform: "materialize, then operate on the
    returned path as a directory." No caller has to reinspect the
    input shape.

    :param source: The spec source. Either a directory containing
        ``config.yaml`` (standard omnigent shape) or a standalone
        omnigent YAML file (e.g.
        ``examples/coding_supervisor.yaml``). Must exist.
    :param dest: Destination directory to populate. Created if it
        does not exist; may be empty or already contain the copied
        contents from a prior call (``shutil.copytree`` is invoked
        with ``dirs_exist_ok=True``).
    :returns: *dest*, always as a populated directory. For the
        directory case the contents are a recursive copy of
        *source*. For the file case the YAML is placed at the root
        of *dest* so
        :func:`omnigent.spec._find_omnigent_yaml_in_dir` picks
        it up on a subsequent :func:`load` call.
    :raises FileNotFoundError: If *source* does not exist.

    other shape (``config.yaml`` present, zero or multiple omnigent

    Load an agent spec from a directory, tarball path, or raw
    bytes.

    If *source* is a directory, parse and validate it directly.
    If *source* is a file path (tarball or omnigent YAML) or raw
    bytes, dispatch accordingly.

    :param source: Path to an agent image directory, ``.tar.gz``
        bundle, omnigent single-file YAML, or raw tarball bytes
        (e.g. from an HTTP upload).
    :param dest: Extraction destination -- required when *source*
        is a tarball or bytes, ignored when *source* is a directory
        or omnigent YAML.
    :param expand_env: Whether to expand ``${VAR}`` references in
        connection blocks, MCP headers, and MCP ``env`` against the
        current process environment. ``True`` (the default) is for
        operator-authored specs whose author is the process owner
        (local ``omnigent run``, ``--agent`` preregistration). It
        MUST be ``False`` for tenant-supplied / HTTP-uploaded
        bundles: expanding their ``${VAR}`` against the server or
        runner process environment leaks server-side secrets into a
        spec-controlled MCP/LLM connection. See
        ``.claude/skills/code-review/security-guidelines.md``.
    :param enforce_handler_allowlist: When ``True``, reject any
        ``type: function`` policy whose handler dotted path is not a
        registered policy handler. This is the guard for the
        untrusted agent-bundle upload path — set by
        :func:`omnigent.server.bundles.validate_agent_bundle`. It is
        applied for both bundle shapes: the omnigent single-file YAML
        path (before the inner loader resolves/calls the handler at
        parse time) and the ``config.yaml`` path (post-parse, since
        that parser does not resolve handlers). Defaults to ``False``
        so trusted spec loading (local ``omnigent run``, operator
        configs) keeps supporting custom handlers.
    :param prune_invalid_sub_agents: When ``True``, a sub-agent that
        fails validation is **dropped** from the spec (removed from
        ``sub_agents`` and from any parent's ``tools.agents``
        reference) and loading continues, instead of failing the whole
        load. A WARNING is logged for each dropped sub-agent. The root
        agent must still validate — a genuine root-level error always
        raises. This is the backwards-compatibility guard for the
        **execution** paths (runner spec resolution, server
        :class:`~omnigent.runtime.agent_cache.AgentCache`): a bundle
        reaching those paths was already validated by the server that
        produced it, so a sub-agent that fails *here* means this client
        is older than that server and can't run that sub-agent (e.g. it
        names a harness this version doesn't know). Dropping the
        sub-agent lets the parent agent launch with the capabilities
        this client *does* support, rather than the whole agent failing
        to start. Defaults to ``False`` so authoring/upload paths
        (``omnigent run``,
        :func:`omnigent.server.bundles.validate_agent_bundle`) stay
        strict and surface real authoring mistakes to the author.
    :returns: A validated :class:`AgentSpec`.
    :raises OmnigentError: If the spec fails validation, if a policy
        names an unregistered handler under
        *enforce_handler_allowlist*, or if *source* is a tarball/bytes
        and *dest* is not provided.

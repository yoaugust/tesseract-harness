    Serialized into the ``GET /v1/harnesses`` catalog (``setup_steps``) so the
    web UI can render a "set up this agent" checklist that mirrors what
    ``omnigent setup`` walks a user through — one row per requirement, in order.

    :param kind: Machine id for the requirement, ``"install"`` or ``"auth"``.
    :param title: Human row label (e.g. ``"Install Codex"``,
        ``"Set up authentication"``).
    :param detail: Optional one-line explanation of what the step means for
        this harness (e.g. "Sign in with your subscription, an API key, or a
        gateway").
    :param action: How the user resolves it — ``"install"`` (a one-click
        install the server performs), ``"auth"`` (the UI opens an inline
        credential form; the harness's subscription login, if any, is one option
        inside it via :attr:`command`), ``"command"`` (a command the user runs
        on the host, in :attr:`command`), or ``"setup"`` (run ``omni setup`` —
        the fallback for auth methods the UI can't drive).
    :param command: The command for ``action="command"``/``"setup"`` steps
        (e.g. ``"codex login"``); ``None`` for one-click installs.
    :param status_key: Which readiness sub-state marks this step done, or
        ``None`` when the host can't determine it (the step renders as an
        informational instruction, not a tracked ✓/○). ``"installed"`` →
        done once the binary is present; ``"authed"`` → done once the harness
        reports it's authenticated.

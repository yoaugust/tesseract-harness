# Deploying the Omnigent Slack bot on Databricks Apps

This directory deploys the **Omnigent Slack bot** to
[Databricks Apps](https://docs.databricks.com/aws/en/dev-tools/databricks-apps/)
via [Asset Bundles](https://docs.databricks.com/aws/en/dev-tools/bundles/).

Deploy the bot here when the Omnigent **server** it talks to is itself a
Databricks App (header/proxy auth). In that mode the bot can't drive the usual
device/OIDC login, so it runs a **custom U2M OAuth app** (authorization code +
PKCE, `offline_access`) via an enrollment page it serves as a Databricks App: a
Slack user signs in at the workspace and the bot receives a durable, refreshable
token it forwards to the server. See `[../../docs/DATABRICKS_APP_WEBAUTH_DESIGN.md](../../docs/DATABRICKS_APP_WEBAUTH_DESIGN.md)`
for the full design, and the integration `[README.md](../../README.md)` for how
the bot works otherwise.

Unlike the server app, the bot needs **no Lakebase and no UC volume** — it's a
stateless pure-PyPI package. `deploy.py` builds an `omnigent_slack` wheel,
generates an app-level `src/pyproject.toml` that points at it (with the bot's
runtime deps inlined from the source pyproject), copies the wheel into `src/`,
then runs `databricks bundle deploy` + `bundle run`. No lockfile is generated:
the app starts with `uv run`, so the Databricks Apps runtime resolves
dependencies in-container at boot. Runs unchanged from a laptop; re-runnable.

> The generated `src/*.whl` and `src/pyproject.toml` are kept **untracked but
> not git-ignored** — `bundle deploy` respects `.gitignore` for its file sync,
> so git-ignoring them would silently drop them from the upload and the app
> would fail with `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'omnigent_slack'`.

## Prerequisites

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **Run this app as a single instance — do NOT enable "Horizontal scaling"
> (Beta).** The bot is a Slack Socket-Mode consumer, so a second replica opens a
> second socket and double-processes every event (duplicate turns); and the
> enrollment PKCE verifiers / unconfirmed tokens live in process memory, so a
> callback routed to a different replica fails closed with a confusing "link
> expired". Databricks Apps are single-instance by default — just leave scaling
> off. (There's no Asset Bundle field to pin instance count during the Beta;
> instance count is UI-only, so this is enforced by not turning it on.)

1. A Databricks workspace with Databricks Apps enabled.
2. A **custom U2M OAuth app** ("custom app integration") registered in the
   workspace with the authorization-code grant enabled — see step 1 below for
   its redirect URI and scopes.
3. The [Databricks CLI](https://docs.databricks.com/aws/en/dev-tools/cli/install.md),
   authenticated via a profile (`--profile`) or env auth.
4. A **Slack app** (Socket Mode + Interactivity) with its bot token (`xoxb-…`)
  and app-level token (`xapp-…`) — see the integration README's *Setup*.
5. The **target Omnigent server app** already deployed as a Databricks App (you
  pass its URL as `--server-url`).
6. Permission to create a **secret scope** and grant the app's service principal
  `READ` on it.

Set your workspace URL in `databricks.yml` under `targets.prod.workspace.host`
(it ships as a `https://example.databricks.com` placeholder; DAB reads it before
resolving variables, so it must be a literal).

## One-time setup



### 1. Create the secret scope + keys

The bundle wires four secrets into the app (never plaintext in YAML). Create the
scope and populate the keys:

```bash
databricks secrets create-scope omnigent-slack

databricks secrets put-secret omnigent-slack slack_bot_token          # xoxb-…
databricks secrets put-secret omnigent-slack slack_app_token          # xapp-…

# Fernet key that encrypts stored tokens at rest:
KEY="$(uv run python -c 'from cryptography.fernet import Fernet; print(Fernet.generate_key().decode())')"
databricks secrets put-secret omnigent-slack token_encryption_key --string-value "$KEY"

# Custom U2M OAuth app secret (see below). The client id is public and passed
# inline via --oauth-client-id, NOT stored here.
databricks secrets put-secret omnigent-slack databricks_oauth_client_secret # <client secret>

# HMAC key signing the enrollment state — its own secret, kept separate from the
# OAuth client secret. Any long random string:
databricks secrets put-secret omnigent-slack databricks_state_secret \
    --string-value "$(openssl rand -hex 32)"
```

> **Register the custom OAuth app first** (a workspace admin, once per
> workspace): create a U2M/"custom app integration" OAuth app in the workspace,
> enable the authorization-code grant, request scopes (`all-apis` by default —
> the token's scopes must be a superset of the target server app's scopes, so
> `all-apis` always works; `openid` + `offline_access` are added automatically),
> and register the redirect URI **`<this-app-url>/auth/callback`**
> (the same app URL you pass as `--app-url`). Because the app URL only
> exists after the first deploy, register the redirect URI between the first and
> second deploy passes.



### 2. First deploy — creates the app + its service principal

Run [Deploy](#deploy) once. The first `bundle deploy` creates the app and its
service principal (SP).

### 3. Grant the app SP read on the secret scope

```bash
databricks secrets put-acl omnigent-slack <app-service-principal> READ
```

Find the SP with `databricks apps get omnigent-slack -o json | jq -r .service_principal_client_id`
(or the name shown in the Apps UI). Re-deploy after granting.

## Deploy

The enrollment link needs this app's **own public URL**, which the platform does
not inject as an env var and which only exists once the app is created — so the
first deploy is a two-pass step.

**First deploy** (creates the app; enrollment link not yet wired):

```bash
uv run python integrations/slack/deploy/databricks/deploy.py \
    --app-name omnigent-slack \
    --profile <your-profile> \
    --secret-scope omnigent-slack \
    --oauth-client-id <oauth-app-client-id> \
    --server-url https://<server-app>.databricksapps.com
```

Read the app's URL, then **re-deploy** with it:

```bash
APP_URL="$(databricks apps get omnigent-slack -o json | jq -r .url)"

uv run python integrations/slack/deploy/databricks/deploy.py \
    --app-name omnigent-slack \
    --profile <your-profile> \
    --secret-scope omnigent-slack \
    --oauth-client-id <oauth-app-client-id> \
    --server-url https://<server-app>.databricksapps.com \
    --app-url "${APP_URL}"
```

`deploy.py` builds the wheel, writes `src/pyproject.toml` (the bot pinned to the
co-located wheel, with its runtime deps inlined from the source pyproject),
copies the wheel into `src/`, runs `bundle deploy --target prod`, then
`bundle run omnigent-slack --target prod`. No lockfile is generated: the app
starts with `uv run`, so the Apps runtime resolves dependencies in-container at
boot. Pass `--skip-run` to deploy without starting, or `--skip-build` to reuse
the existing `src/` wheel + pyproject. Subsequent redeploys are a single
invocation (keep `--app-url`).

## After deploy

1. Confirm the app is **Running** and that the custom OAuth app's redirect URI
   matches this app's `<url>/auth/callback` exactly.
2. In Slack, run `/omnigent`. The modal shows a **Sign in with Databricks**
  link pointing at the workspace `/oidc/v1/authorize`. Complete it; Databricks
   redirects to this app's `/auth/callback`, which shows a **consent page** —
   click **Confirm** to link the accounts, the token is stored, and the modal
   advances to agent/host selection.
3. Grant each intended Slack user **workspace access to the server app** (the
  token only authenticates for users who can reach the server app).



## How it works

- The app runs the OAuth callback web server (`omnigent_slack/webauth.py`) and,
in the same process, the Socket-Mode bot that connects out to Slack.
- **Custom U2M OAuth app (authorization code + PKCE).** The enrollment link is
the workspace `/oidc/v1/authorize` URL; the user signs in and Databricks
redirects back to `/auth/callback` with a single-use, PKCE-bound code. The bot
exchanges it at `/oidc/v1/token` for an **access + refresh** pair
(`offline_access`), shows a consent page naming the identities, and — only on
**Confirm** — stores the token and presents the access token as the bearer to
the server (the server's proxy validates it and injects the real
`X-Forwarded-Email`). The
token is bounded by the OAuth app's scopes.
- **Durable across restarts of the grant, ephemeral on disk.** The SQLite token
store lives on ephemeral disk (`OMNIGENT_DATA_DIR=/tmp/omnigent-slack`),
encrypted at rest; a restart loses it and the user re-enrolls. But within a
grant's life the bot refreshes the access token via the refresh token, so a user
signs in once rather than hourly.

## Troubleshooting


| Symptom | Cause | Fix |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'omnigent_slack'` | The wheel/`pyproject.toml` were git-ignored, so `bundle deploy` didn't sync them | Ensure `src/*.whl`, `src/pyproject.toml` are untracked but NOT git-ignored; re-run `deploy.py` (not `--skip-build` on a clean `src/`) |
| App fails to boot; `/logz` shows a `uv run` resolve error or PyPI timeout | Dependency resolution runs in-container at boot; the runtime couldn't reach PyPI | Confirm the app egress can reach PyPI (or the Databricks proxy); retry the `bundle run` |
| Sign-in ends on an OAuth error page (redirect mismatch) | The OAuth app's redirect URI ≠ `<this-app-url>/auth/callback` | Register the exact `/auth/callback` URL on the custom OAuth app |
| Sign-in page says the link was already used or expired | The redirect was replayed, or the bot restarted between link-issue and callback (in-memory PKCE verifier lost) | Run `/omnigent` again for a fresh link |
| Enrolled, but turns fail auth against the server                      | User lacks access to the server app, or the token's scopes don't satisfy the server proxy | Grant the user server-app access; widen `OMNIGENT_SLACK_DATABRICKS_SCOPES` if the server proxy needs more |
| App boots but Slack shows no sign-in link                             | `--app-url` not passed (the app URL only exists after first deploy) | Re-deploy with `--app-url "$(databricks apps get <app> -o json | jq -r .url)"` |
| App can't read secrets                                                | App SP missing scope ACL                                                     | `databricks secrets put-acl <scope> <sp> READ`, redeploy                                |
| Plan shows destroy/replace of the app                                 | `--app-name` mismatch vs. tracked state                                      | Re-check `--app-name`; state is per-app under `root_path`                               |

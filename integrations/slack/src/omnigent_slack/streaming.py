"""Streamed-answer machinery for a Slack turn.

``_LiveReply`` wraps Slack's ``chat.*Stream`` API (buffering, seal-for-ordering,
reopen-on-finalize). ``_AnswerReply`` layers the turn's answer semantics on top:
the "Working on it…" ack lifecycle, seal-⇒-forget across interruptions, and the
tail reconciliation that recovers a committed final item the deltas didn't carry.
Also home to the ``SlackClientProtocol``/``SlackStreamProtocol`` structural types
(the Slack-client surface the whole package depends on).

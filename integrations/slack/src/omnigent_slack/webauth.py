"""Enrollment web server for the Databricks U2M OAuth flow.

Runs inside the bot process and serves the OAuth **redirect callback** of a
custom Databricks OAuth app (authorization code + PKCE). Routes, behind the
bot's own Databricks App URL:

- ``GET /`` / ``GET /health`` — liveness for the platform.
- ``GET /auth/callback?code=<…>&state=<signed>`` — the OAuth redirect landing.
  Databricks sends the browser here after the user signs in. This route verifies
  the signed ``state`` (which binds the session to the Slack ``(team, user,
  email)`` that requested it and carries a single-use nonce), consumes the PKCE
  ``code_verifier`` the bot generated for that nonce, exchanges the code for a
  durable **access + refresh** token, checks that the OAuth-authenticated email
  matches the requesting Slack user, then shows a **consent page** naming both
  identities — storing **nothing** yet.
- ``POST /auth/callback`` — submitted by the consent page's Confirm button.
  Persists the tokens exchanged on the GET (stashed under a single-use confirm
  id) so the Socket-Mode bot can act as the user — and refresh without
  re-enrollment. Storing only on this explicit POST means a credential is never
  persisted without the user affirming the Omnigent↔Slack account linkage.

The authorization code is single-use, so it's exchanged once on the GET and the
resulting tokens held in a short-lived in-memory stash until the confirming POST.

The state signing/verification lives in :mod:`omnigent_slack.enrollment_state`;
the OAuth client in :mod:`omnigent_slack.databricks_oauth`. See
``docs/DATABRICKS_APP_WEBAUTH_DESIGN.md``.

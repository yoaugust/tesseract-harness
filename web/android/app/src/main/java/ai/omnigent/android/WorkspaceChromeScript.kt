 * [BlobDownloadScript].
 *
 * Ported from `web/electron/src/workspace-chrome.js`; the iOS shell carries the
 * same logic in `WorkspaceChromeScript.swift`. Keep the CSS identical in all
 * three so a fix in one shell isn't silently missing from the others.

     * it in its top-nav shell (the dark bar with the workspace switcher). In a
     * dedicated app window that chrome is just noise. We promote Omnigent's own
     * root — `.omnigent-app`, which the embed entry sets (`web/src/embed.tsx`) — to
     * a full-viewport overlay so it paints over the workspace bar. Keying on
     * Omnigent's wrapper (defined in THIS repo) rather than the monolith-owned,
     * unstable workspace nav markup keeps this from silently breaking when
     * Databricks reshuffles its chrome; on a standalone (non-embed) build there is
     * no `.omnigent-app`, so the rule is a harmless no-op.

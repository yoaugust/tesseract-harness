// webContents whose URL is NOT under the workspace mount path.
//
// The original bug gated injection behind `pathname.startsWith(
// WORKSPACE_UI_PATH)`, so on such URLs (auth redirects, path variants) the CSS
// never landed and the Databricks workspace switcher stayed visible.
// Reintroducing any URL/path guard inside applyWorkspaceChromeHideCss stops
// insertCSS from firing here, failing this test.

// Hiding the Databricks workspace navigation chrome around a workspace-hosted
// Omnigent SPA. Kept in its own Electron-free module so the injection logic is
// unit-testable (test/workspace-chrome.test.js calls applyWorkspaceChromeHideCss
// with a fake webContents) without requiring main.js, which boots the app.
//
// The mobile shells carry the same logic in
// web/android/.../WorkspaceChromeScript.kt and
// web/ios/Omnigent/WorkspaceChromeScript.swift. Keep the CSS identical in all
// three so a fix in one shell isn't silently missing from the others.

/**
 * CSS that hides the Databricks workspace navigation chrome.
 *
 * On a workspace the SPA is mounted as a workspace *page*, so Databricks wraps
 * it in its top-nav shell (the dark bar with the workspace switcher). In a
 * dedicated desktop window that chrome is just noise. We promote Omnigent's
 * own root — ``.omnigent-app``, the wrapper web's embed entry sets
 * (``web/src/embed.tsx``) — to a full-viewport overlay so it paints over
 * the workspace bar. Keying on Omnigent's wrapper (defined in THIS repo)
 * rather than the monolith-owned, unstable workspace nav markup keeps this
 * from silently breaking when Databricks reshuffles its chrome; on a
 * standalone (non-embed) build there is no ``.omnigent-app``, so the rule is
 * a harmless no-op.

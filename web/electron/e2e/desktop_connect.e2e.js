// Example desktop-shell recording lane: the connect journey.
//
// This is the reference test a repro-agent COPIES for a desktop-shell bug
// (see e2e/README.md). It films the real Electron window: launch on the
// bundled setup page, type a server URL, Connect, and land in the app shell.
// The recorded .webm is the desktop journey a user sees — the artifact the
// repro-agent attaches for a `web`/desktop facet.
//
// Run: `node --test e2e/desktop_connect.e2e.js` from web/electron, AFTER
// building the SPA (pnpm --filter web run build). Skips cleanly when electron
// or playwright aren't installed (they're not in the web-test CI path).

 *    whatever the session was bound to), regardless of wrapper.
 * 2. `local_stranded` — the session isn't host-bound, so the user

/**
 * Dialog surfaced when the open session is unreachable — the host is

 * but the host is up: there the composer stays open and typing silently
 * relaunches the runner (see `useSessionLiveness`).
 *
 * Two tabs:
 * - **Reconnect** — a one-line instruction plus the CLI command. For a
 *   non-owner of a `host_offline` session — who can't reach the host
 *   machine — the command is dropped and the text explains that only
 *   the owner can reconnect.
 * - **Clone** — the same {@link ForkSessionForm} the header-menu Clone
 *   dialog uses (one fork implementation, two entry points), so the
 *   user can continue in a copy they own without leaving the dialog.
 *
 * The default tab is Reconnect, except for the non-owner `host_offline`
 * case where reconnecting is impossible and Clone is the only action.
 *
 * @param wrapper - The conversation's `omnigent.wrapper` label
 *   (`"claude-code-native-ui"` for `omnigent claude` sessions). Picks
 *   the `local_stranded` command form.
 * @param state - Which unreachable state we're reconnecting from.
 * @param isOwner - Whether the viewer owns the session. Gates the
 *   reconnect command for `host_offline`.
 * @param sourceTitle - Source title for the Clone tab's name prefill.
 * @param sourceWorkspace - Source workspace; marks a coding source for
 *   the Clone tab (host/directory pickers).
 * @param sourceHostId - Source host for the Clone tab's host prefill.
 * @param sourceGitBranch - Source git branch for the Clone tab's
 *   worktree base-ref prefill.

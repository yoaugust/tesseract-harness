// Persistent WebSocket client for `WS /v1/sessions/updates`.
//
// Replaces the sidebar's 4 s HTTP poll of `GET /v1/sessions` with a single
// long-lived connection: the client tells the server which session ids it's
// displaying (the "watch-set"), and the server pushes a snapshot followed by
// diffs whenever those sessions change. See the server endpoint docstring in
// `omnigent/server/routes/sessions.py` for the wire protocol.
//
// This module owns only the transport (connect, reconnect, send watch-set,
// dispatch frames). SessionUpdatesProvider wires the parsed frames into the
// TanStack Query cache and derives the watch-set from it.
//
// Identity rides the transport exactly like the terminal-attach WebSocket:
// the browser cannot set `X-Forwarded-Email` on a WebSocket handshake, so we
// rely on the ingress / dev proxy to carry the authenticated identity. The
// id list is NEVER trusted from the client for authorization — the server
// access-checks every watched id against the connection's user.

/**
 * Build the `ws(s)://` URL for the session-updates endpoint.
 *
 * Delegates to the host seam (`resolveWebSocketUrl`), exactly like the
 * terminal-attach socket: standalone builds the URL from the page origin
 * (whether served by the Omnigent server directly or through the Vite dev proxy),
 * and an embedding host rebases it onto its proxied WS surface.
 *
 * When a host fetcher is installed, append `?omnigent_slice_key=<frozen modal
 * host>`. A browser WebSocket handshake can't set request headers, so the
 * routing key rides the query string (the same seam the terminal-attach WS
 * uses). This WS watches sessions across MANY hosts, so no single key is
 * "correct" — it's a NICE-TO-HAVE load/perf lever: keying by the modal host
 * (the one backing most of the user's sessions) lands the standing rescan on
 * the replica most likely holding their sessions' tunnels, so the per-session
 * status read hits that replica's warm relay cache instead of the cross-replica
 * fallback, and spreads the standing connections finer than per-tenant.
 * Correctness is unaffected (the rescan reads are replica-safe).
 *
 * The key comes from {@link modalHostId}, which is resolved once and never
 * changes for the page — so every auto-reconnect rebuilds the identical URL and
 * never re-keys (no connection churn). The provider only calls `start()` once
 * the modal host is resolved (see `isModalHostResolved`), so this reads a
 * settled value. Omitted on an unsharded server and when no host was picked.

// Pure helpers for the "fork / switch agent" flows: decide which target
// harnesses preserve the source's conversation history (and so should appear
// in each picker). Three carry mechanisms, all keyed off the TARGET harness —
// a frontend mirror of the server (omnigent/server/routes/sessions.py):
//
//   - SDK (non-native) harnesses replay the Omnigent transcript as LLM
//     context — carry on BOTH fork and switch, regardless of source/family.
//   - Native-REBUILD harnesses (Claude Code, Codex, Pi, Hermes, Qwen Code)
//     record a resumable on-disk session file the runner rebuilds from the
//     copied Omnigent items (a same-family native source clones the source
//     file instead; cross-family rebuilds, format-agnostic) — carry on BOTH
//     fork and switch. Mirrors `_FORK_HISTORY_NATIVE_HARNESSES`.
//   - PREAMBLE harnesses (Cursor, OpenCode) have no rebuildable local store,
//     so prior turns replay as a text preamble on the fork's first message —
//     FORK-ONLY. An in-place switch-agent has no first-message injection
//     point, so switching into one starts fresh. Mirrors
//     `_CURSOR_FORK_HISTORY_HARNESSES`.
//
// Hence two predicates: forkTargetCarriesHistory (rebuild ∪ preamble ∪ SDK)
// and switchTargetCarriesHistory (rebuild ∪ SDK — no preamble). Native
// harnesses with no carry path (kiro/kimi/goose) are offered by neither; an
// unclassifiable harness (catalog harness=null) is conservatively dropped.

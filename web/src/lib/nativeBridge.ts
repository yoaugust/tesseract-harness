// Bridge between the web app and the optional native shells.
//
// The SAME `web` bundle runs in two places:
//   1. A normal browser tab (served by the Omnigent server).

//      that exact server-served bundle in a Chromium BrowserWindow.
//   3. Inside the iOS wrapper (`web/ios`), which loads the same bundle in
//      a WKWebView.
//
// In native cases we can do better than the Web platform: fire OS-native
// notifications and paint an app badge count via a small injected bridge. In
// case (1) none of that exists, so every function here degrades to a no-op /
// `false` and the caller falls back to the Web Notifications path it already
// has.
//
// Design notes:
//   * Detection is feature-based (an injected `window.omnigentNative` or the
//     legacy Electron `window.omnigentDesktop` object), never a build flag —
//     one bundle, multiple runtimes, decided at runtime.
//   * This module never throws: a broken/old shell must not take down
//     notifications in the browser path.

// Why top-level Smart Routing can (or can't) be offered on the new-chat
// landing, and how to say so.
//
// The landing drops a Smart Routing pick it can't honour. Five different
// conditions cause that, and they need different words: a server with routing
// switched off is not a deployment whose only router is the built-in judge, is
// not a deployment whose native wrapper agents aren't registered, and is not a
// host whose CLI runs off something other than the workspace AI gateway.

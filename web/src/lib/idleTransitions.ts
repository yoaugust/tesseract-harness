// unarchiving diffs against real prior state, not a phantom transition.

 * accumulated client-side state — so the badge matches what the sidebar
 * flags as needing attention, including sessions that finished while this
 * window wasn't open.
 *
 * A session counts as unread when it is NOT actively viewed (the window is
 * focused AND it's the open conversation — the one suppression rule; a
 * blurred window means even the open conversation counts) AND either:
 *
 *   * it has pending elicitations (the sidebar's "awaiting input" badge), or
 *   * \`isUnseen\` says it has activity since the user last had it open (the
 *     sidebar's unread dot — see \`isConversationUnseen\`).
 *
 * \`isUnseen\` is injected rather than imported so this module stays free of
 * localStorage and directly unit-testable.
 *
 * :param conversations: The current conversation list.
 * :param activeId: The conversation currently open in the UI, or undefined
 *   when on a non-chat route, e.g. \`"conv_a"\`.
 * :param windowFocused: Whether the app window itself has focus.
 * :param isUnseen: Predicate matching \`isConversationUnseen\`'s signature —
 *   whether a session has unseen activity, given its id, \`updated_at\`, and
 *   status.
 * :returns: The unread-session id set; its size is the badge number.

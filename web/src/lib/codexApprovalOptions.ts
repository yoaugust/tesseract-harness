// Create-time Codex approvals include an explicit full-bypass option in the
// composer's permission picker, separate from runtime approval presets.
//
// SCOPE: create-time only. A running codex session switches approval through
// Codex's `/permissions` popup, which has no bypass row (bypass is a launch
// flag) — see `@/lib/codexApprovalMode`. So the running-session picker keeps the
// runtime presets (no bypass); this module never widens that surface, and
// nothing here auto-enables bypass.

// App-level wrapper that exposes per-session liveness via context so
// hooks can gate on runner / host reachability without each standing up
// its own poller.
//
// The sidebar's many rows get liveness from the `WS /v1/sessions/updates`
// push stream, which folds `runner_online` + `host_online` onto the watched
// conversation rows in the cache. The OPEN session additionally gets a
// direct single-session `GET /health` poll (`useRunnerHealth`), because the
// stream only re-emits on DB-backed changes and a runner tunnel dropping is
// an in-memory event it never pushes — so the stream's runner_online would
// go stale-online for a crashed runner. The poll is scoped to the open
// session (plus any sessions a transient view registered) — never the whole
// sidebar list, so it's one request, not the old fleet-wide poll.
//
// Two maps are exposed:
//   - runner-online (`Map<string, boolean>`) — strict runner-tunnel
//     liveness, read by the open-session view (send-gate / banner) and
//     by the new-session dialog's conflict hint via registration.
//   - host-online (`Map<string, boolean | null>`) — the host tunnel,
//     `null` when the session isn't host-bound. Consumed by the
//     open-session view to choose the right message when the runner is
//     offline (host up vs. host down).

// Cmd+Enter (Ctrl+Enter on Win/Linux) accepts the pending harness approval
// prompt — the keyboard equivalent of clicking "Accept" on an ApprovalCard.
// Bind ONCE at the app shell.
//
// Runs in the CAPTURE phase so it can intercept the keystroke before the
// composer's own Enter-to-send handler (which fires during bubble and would
// otherwise submit the draft first). When it actually accepts an approval it
// stops the event so the composer never sees it; when nothing is pending it
// leaves the event untouched, so Cmd/Ctrl+Enter keeps whatever meaning it had.
//
// Only plain accept/decline prompts (command, edit, plan, codex command) are
// accepted. AskUserQuestion elicitations are skipped: they require choosing a
// specific option, so a blanket "accept" carries no answer and the user must
// pick on the card itself. An elicitation whose `requestedSchema` names
// fields is skipped for exactly that reason — the server asked for values,
// and accepting from the keyboard would send it none of them.
//
// A chord that lands in a text field holding a draft is also skipped: the
// user was mid-composition when the prompt appeared, and Cmd/Ctrl+Enter is a
// send chord there (the ONLY send key under the Mod+Enter preference). A
// keystroke that expressed send intent must never resolve a permission
// prompt that mounted moments earlier.

 * @-mentions with an empty value), so the composer marks itself with
 * `data-has-draft` and that marker counts too. An EMPTY, unmarked field
 * carries no send intent, so the chord still accepts from there (the common

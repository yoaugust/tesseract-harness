/**
 * Contains a throw from the markdown pipeline to the one block that threw.
 *
 * Streamdown renders mermaid diagrams behind `React.lazy`, and a rejected lazy
 * import is re-thrown on every subsequent render (Suspense catches pending
 * imports, not failed ones). With no boundary above it React unmounts the whole
 * tree, so a single un-renderable diagram — a stale tab whose hashed mermaid
 * chunk no longer exists, say — blanks the entire app.
 *
 * Wrap every `Streamdown` seam so a block that can't render degrades to its own
 * markdown source and the rest of the page keeps working. Deliberately does not
 * reset when `children` change: React.lazy caches a rejection forever, so a
 * retry would only throw again.
 *
 * Streamdown's own lazy facades ship inside its statically-loaded chunk
 * (web/vite.streamdown.ts), so those imports cannot reject mid-session; the
 * boundary stays as containment for any other throw in the pipeline.

// Dispatch from a `RenderItem` to the right component. Pure switch on
// `item.kind`. Compaction renders as a standalone `Bubble` in
// `ChatPage`, not as an inline render item — no case for it here.
//
// Two levels of collapsing keep a turn readable:
//
// 1. Tool-run folding: within a contiguous run of tool / native_tool
//    items, tools fold into a single summary line describing what's
//    hidden ("Read 2 files", rendered by `ToolGroupSummary`). While
//    the run is the live activity, the trailing `STREAMING_TAIL`
//    tools stay visible as individual rows so the user can watch
//    recent steps. Still-in-progress spinners and durable
//    routing/fan-out cards never fold regardless of position.
//
// 2. Turn folding: once the turn settles (`turnLifecycle` leaves
//    "streaming"), the whole process trace — interstitial narration,
//    tool folds, reasoning — collapses behind one muted "Worked for
//    Xs" row (`TurnWorkedFold`), leaving only the trailing final
//    answer visible. This mirrors the Codex desktop treatment: the
//    demarcation makes "where do I start reading" obvious instead of
//    a wall of uniform prose. Resolved approval cards fold with the
//    trace in document order; pending elicitations and persistent
//    routing/dispatch cards stay visible outside the fold; a turn
//    with no trailing answer (interrupted / failed / tool-only step
//    bubbles) keeps its trace expanded.

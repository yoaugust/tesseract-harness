/// A parsed `omnigent://<hostname>/c/<session_id>` deep link — the iOS analog
/// of the desktop shell's `parseOmnigentDeepLink` (web/electron/src/deepLink.js),
/// kept pure so it unit-tests without a WKWebView. See designs/desktop-deep-link.md
/// for the shared design (URL shape, scheme inference, security rationale).
///
/// The link names a server by **host** (with port if non-default) and a
/// conversation by the SPA's own `/c/:id` route. It carries no `http`/`https` —
/// the scheme is inferred with the same rule the setup page and desktop use
/// (`http` for loopback, `https` for a remote host), so a deep link and a pasted
/// URL never disagree on scheme. The Databricks workspace mount
/// is deliberately NOT in the link; it is server-determined and discovered by
/// `WorkspaceURLExpander` (after consent, for an unknown server).
///
/// ## Custom-scheme vs Universal Links
///
/// `omnigent://` is a **custom URL scheme** registered via `CFBundleURLSchemes`
/// in the Info plist. iOS does NOT verify single ownership of a custom scheme:
/// any other installed app can also declare `omnigent` and win the launch race,
/// receiving the raw link — and with it the server host and conversation id
/// (metadata disclosure) — before this app ever sees it. Treat the custom
/// scheme as untrusted for that reason.
///
/// For **managed Databricks domains** (known, HTTPS, operator-controlled hosts
/// that CAN serve an `apple-app-site-association` file), prefer **Universal
/// Links** (`applinks:<host>` in the app's Associated Domains Entitlement,
/// backed by a verified `apple-app-site-association` on the domain). Universal
/// Links are cryptographically pinned to the domain, cannot be hijacked by a
/// co-installed app, and open from a plain `https://…/c/<id>` URL with no custom
/// scheme at all — eliminating the interception risk entirely. Wiring that
/// up is out of scope for this parser (it concerns the SPA's link emission +
/// the app's entitlements/AASA serving, not parsing), but any link source that
/// CAN use a Universal Link should.
///
/// The custom scheme is retained for **BYO / OSS self-hosted servers** whose
/// operators cannot host an `apple-app-site-association` file — loopback hosts,
/// LAN IPs, and personal domains without verified HTTPS. For those, document
/// the interception risk to users: assume a malicious co-installed app may read
/// the server host and conversation id from a clicked `omnigent://` link. The
/// id carries no secret (it is a server-assigned UUID; access is still gated by
/// the server's own auth), but the host does reveal which server the user runs.
